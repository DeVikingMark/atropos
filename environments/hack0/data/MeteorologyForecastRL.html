Okay, let's tackle this weather analysis for station ILX. The user provided NWP model sounding data from the RAP model for 06Z on 20250314, valid at 0600Z. The goal is to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z on that day.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction, and some indices like SRH, LI, PW, etc. Let me start by looking at the key parameters that indicate severe weather potential.</p>
<p>The surface observations show a temperature of 19°C and dew point of 10°C. The dew point depression is 9°C, which is moderate. The wind at the surface is from 151 degrees (south-southeast) at 9 m/s. The 850 hPa level has a temperature of 13°C, dew point 8°C, and wind from 168 degrees (south) at 25 m/s. The 700 hPa level has a temperature of 1°C, dew point -10°C, and wind from 185 degrees (south-southwest) at 23 m/s. The 500 hPa is -17°C, dew point -40°C, wind 235 degrees at 21 m/s. The 250 hPa is -54°C, dew point -40°C, wind 256 degrees at 49 m/s.</p>
<p>Looking at the lifted index (LI) which is 1.9. A LI above 0 indicates unstable conditions, but not extremely so. However, the storm relative helicity (SRH) values are SRH1e=76 and SRH3e=107. SRH is important for tornado potential. SRH1e is for the lowest 1 km, and SRH3e for the lowest 3 km. Both values are above 150? Wait, no, 76 and 107. Wait, SRH values around 150-200 are considered high for tornadoes. So 107 might be on the lower side. But maybe in combination with other factors?</p>
<p>The buoyancy parameter (BS06) is 26. This is the buoyant energy index, which measures the potential for convection. Higher values indicate more instability. The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is a bit high, indicating a moist atmosphere. The freezing level (FZLh) is at 2951 meters, which is about 9700 feet. The wind shear is present, especially between the surface and 700 hPa levels. The wind direction changes from south-southeast at surface to south at 850 hPa, then south-southwest at 700 hPa. This could indicate some wind shear, but is it enough for severe thunderstorms?</p>
<p>The lapse rate (LR75) is -6.8°C per 100m, which is a steep lapse rate, indicating instability. The Showalter index (sCP) is 18, which is a measure of atmospheric stability. A lower value indicates more instability. The most unstable parcel temperature (mCP) is 745, which might be a typo? Wait, looking back, the parameters are sCP (surface-based convective precipitation?), mCN is -2. Maybe I need to check the parameters again. Wait, the parameters in the data are:</p>
<p>sCP: surface-based convective precipitation? Maybe not. Let me check the parameters again. The data includes sCP (maybe surface-based convective precipitation?), sCN (surface-based convective temperature?), mCP (most unstable parcel temperature?), mCN (most unstable parcel dew point?), sLCLh (lifted condensation level height), DCPk (dew point depression at the lifting condensation level?), BS06 (buoyant energy index), SRH1e (storm relative helicity at 1e?), SRH3e (storm relative helicity at 3e?), PW (precipitable water), LI (lifted index), FZLh (freezing level height), WBZh (wet bulb zero height), LR75 (lapse rate from 700 to 500 hPa?), SHIP (supercell composite parameter?), kl is the list of levels with p, h, t, td, ws, wd.</p>
<p>Wait, the parameters might be different. For example, sCP could be surface-based convective precipitation, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on the more standard parameters like LI, SRH, PW, and wind shear.</p>
<p>The LI is 1.9, which is slightly positive, suggesting some instability. However, for severe thunderstorms, the LI is typically more negative. But with other factors, maybe it's enough. The SRH values are 76 and 107. The SRH1e is for the lowest 1 km, and SRH3e for the lowest 3 km. Both are moderate. The PW is 21.8, which is high, indicating a moist environment. The freezing level is at 2951 m, which is relatively low, so if thunderstorms develop, they could produce hail. The wind shear from the surface to 700 hPa is significant, with wind direction changing from south-southeast to south-southwest, which could contribute to rotation.</p>
<p>The buoyant energy index (BS06) is 26, which is moderate. The SHIP parameter is 0.9, which is low, suggesting a lower chance of supercells. However, the SRH values combined with the PW and instability could still lead to severe thunderstorms, but maybe not supercells.</p>
<p>But the LI is only 1.9, which is not extremely unstable. Maybe the instability is not strong enough for severe thunderstorms. However, the wind shear is present, and the PW is high. Maybe there's a chance for isolated severe thunderstorms, especially if there's a trigger like a cold front or boundary.</p>
<p>However, the user is asking for a preliminary forecast. So, the model data shows some instability, moderate wind shear, and a moist environment. But the LI is only slightly positive. Maybe the model is underestimating the instability? Or perhaps the parameters are not all indicating severe weather.</p>
<p>I should check if there's any other parameters I'm missing. The LR75 is -6.8°C per 100m, which is a steep lapse rate, contributing to instability. The dew point depression at the surface is 9°C, which is moderate. The dew point at the surface is 10°C, and the temperature is 19°C, so the dew point depression is 9°C. The 700 hPa level has a dew point of -10°C, which is very low, indicating dry air aloft, which could lead to strong downdrafts if there's instability.</p>
<p>So, combining the steep lapse rate, moist layer near the surface, dry air aloft, and moderate wind shear, there could be a potential for severe thunderstorms. However, the LI is only 1.9, which is on the borderline. The SRH values are moderate, so maybe a chance of tornadoes? Or perhaps not. The SHIP is 0.9, which is low, suggesting a lower chance of supercells.</p>
<p>But without real-time data, like radar or satellite, I can't confirm if there are any boundaries or triggers. So, maybe I should suggest getting real-time observations to check for any nearby boundaries, like a cold front or a gust front, which could trigger convection. Also, the surface wind is from the south-southeast, which might indicate a low-level jet, contributing to wind shear.</p>
<p>Therefore, the preliminary forecast is that there's a potential for isolated severe thunderstorms, but the severity is uncertain. The model data suggests some instability and wind shear, but the LI is only slightly positive. To get a better assessment, I should check for real-time surface observations to see if there are any boundaries or changes in wind direction that could trigger convection. Also, radar and satellite imagery could show any developing thunderstorms or cloud patterns.</p>
<p>So, the tools needed would be get_surface_observations to check for boundaries, get_latest_radar_imagery to see any existing storms, and get_satellite_imagery for cloud patterns. But since the user is asking for a preliminary assessment, maybe only the surface observations are crucial here. Alternatively, upper air soundings might be needed if there's a discrepancy between model and actual conditions. However, the data given is from the model, so maybe the user wants to check if there's a need for additional data.</p>
<p>Wait, the available tools are get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, get_upper_air_sounding. The data provided is from the RAP model, so the upper air sounding is already given. But perhaps the model's data might not be accurate, so getting actual upper air data would be helpful. However, the user is asking for a preliminary forecast based on the provided model data. But the user's instruction says to specify tools if additional real-time data is crucial. So, if the model data is the only input, but the analysis is preliminary, maybe the tools are necessary to confirm the conditions.</p>
<p>So, I should call get_surface_observations to check for any nearby boundaries, get_latest_radar_imagery to see if there are any storms already developing, and get_satellite_imagery for cloud patterns. However, the user might not have those tools available, but according to the instructions, I need to output the TOOL_CALL lines if needed.</p>
<p>But given the model data, maybe the tools are not necessary. However, the user might want to ensure that the analysis is accurate, so adding the tools would make the assessment more robust. Therefore, I should include the TOOL_CALLs for get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, and get_satellite_imagery.<br />

<li><strong>Analysis of Key Parameters</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Instability</strong>: The Lifted Index (LI) is 1.9, indicating marginal instability. While not strongly unstable, combined with a steep lapse rate (LR75 = -6.8°C/100m) and high precipitable water (PW = 21.8 mm), there is potential for convection.</li>
<li><strong>Wind Shear</strong>: Surface-to-700 hPa wind shear is significant (direction shifts from 151° to 185°, speeds increase from 9 to 23 m/s). SRH1e (76) and SRH3e (107) suggest moderate storm-relative helicity, which could support rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Moisture</strong>: High PW (21.8 mm) and surface dew point (10°C) indicate a moist boundary layer, aiding in thunderstorm development.</li>
<li><strong>Dry Air Aloft</strong>: Dew point at 700 hPa (-10°C) and 500 hPa (-40°C) suggests dry air aloft, which can enhance downdrafts and hail potential.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freezing Level</strong>: FZLh at 2951 m (~9700 ft) implies hail is possible if convection develops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Severe Weather Potential</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>Marginal instability (LI = 1.9) and moderate wind shear could lead to <strong>isolated severe thunderstorms</strong> with hail, though tornado potential is low due to SRH values below 150 and SHIP = 0.9.</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>low-level jet</strong> (surface winds from 151°, 850 hPa winds from 168°) may act as a trigger for convection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Data Gaps</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Surface Observations</strong>: Missing nearby boundaries (e.g., cold fronts) that could trigger convection.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Radar/Satellite</strong>: No imagery to confirm storm development or cloud patterns.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upper Air Sounding</strong>: While provided, real-time data could validate model accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TOOL_CALLS</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Surface Observations</strong>: To identify nearby boundaries or changes in wind direction.  </li>
<li><strong>Radar Imagery</strong>: To detect existing storms or convergence zones.  </li>
<li><strong>Satellite Imagery</strong>: To analyze cloud patterns and moisture distribution.  </li>

Okay, let's tackle this weather analysis for station ILX. The user provided NWP model sounding data from the RAP model for 06Z on 03/14/2025, valid at 0600Z. They want a preliminary forecast focusing on severe weather potential around 0700Z.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding data includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction at different pressure levels. Let me go through each level step by step.</p>
<p>Starting with the surface data: pressure is 984 hPa, temperature 19°C, dew point 10°C. The wind is from 151 degrees (south-southeast) at 9 m/s. The mixing ratio (mCN) is -2, which might indicate a dry layer. The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is close to the threshold for instability. Usually, LI values below -1 indicate instability, so 1.9 is on the higher side, suggesting some instability but not extreme.</p>
<p>Looking at the 850 hPa level: temperature 13°C, dew point 8°C. Wind is 168 degrees (southwest) at 25 m/s. The temperature is lower than the surface, which might contribute to instability. The dew point is slightly lower than the temperature, so there's some moisture but not a lot. The wind shear here could be a factor for severe weather, but I need to check other levels.</p>
<p>At 700 hPa: temperature 1°C, dew point -10°C. Wind is 185 degrees (south) at 23 m/s. The temperature is much lower, and the dew point is very cold, indicating a dry layer. The wind direction is changing from southwest to south, which might indicate some wind shear. The wind speed is around 23 m/s, which is significant.</p>
<p>At 500 hPa: temperature -17°C, dew point -40°C. Wind is 235 degrees (southwest) at 21 m/s. The temperature is very cold, and the dew point is extremely low, suggesting a very dry layer. The wind direction is shifting again, which could indicate increasing wind shear with height.</p>
<p>At 250 hPa: temperature -54°C, dew point -40°C. Wind is 256 degrees (southwest) at 49 m/s. The wind speed is very high here, and the temperature is extremely cold. The wind direction is consistent with the previous levels, but the speed is much higher, indicating strong upper-level winds. This could contribute to a cap or a strong jet stream, which might affect storm development.</p>
<p>Now, looking at the parameters provided: the SRH1e (storm relative helicity) is 76, and SRH3e is 107. These values are in the range that could contribute to rotation, but not extremely high. The LI is 1.9, which is weakly unstable. The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is moderate. The FZLh (freezing level height) is 2951 meters, which is relatively high, meaning that if precipitation occurs, it might not reach the surface as freezing rain unless the freezing level is lower. The WBZh (wet bulb zero height) is 2307 meters, which is the height where the wet bulb temperature reaches zero. This could indicate the potential for freezing rain if the freezing level is below the WBZ.</p>
<p>The Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) is at 1082 meters, which is the height where the parcel becomes saturated. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) is -391 J/kg (sCN), which is negative, indicating that there's no inhibition to convection. The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is 745 J/kg (mCP), which is high. Wait, the data shows mCP as 745, which I think refers to CAPE. If CAPE is 745, that's a high value, indicating a lot of instability. However, the LI is 1.9, which is not very negative. This seems contradictory. Maybe the LI is calculated differently here, or there's a mistake. High CAPE with a low LI could mean that the atmosphere is unstable but the lifting index isn't capturing it well. Alternatively, maybe the LI is calculated using a different method. I need to check if the parameters are correctly interpreted.</p>
<p>The Ship value is 0.9, which might be the Showalter index. A value around 0.9 is close to neutral, so not a strong indicator of instability. However, the CAPE is high, so there's a mix here. The SRH values are moderate, so some rotation potential but not extreme. The PW is moderate, which could contribute to heavy rain if convection occurs.</p>
<p>Now, considering the wind shear. The surface wind is from the south-southeast, 9 m/s. At 850 hPa, it's southwest at 25 m/s. At 700 hPa, south at 23 m/s. At 500 hPa, southwest at 21 m/s. At 250 hPa, southwest at 49 m/s. The wind direction is changing from south to southwest, but the speed is increasing with height, especially at 250 hPa. This could indicate a strong jet stream or a wind shear that might contribute to severe weather, especially if the CAPE is high enough.</p>
<p>However, the LI is 1.9, which is not very negative, suggesting that the atmosphere isn't very unstable. But the CAPE is 745 J/kg, which is high. This discrepancy might be because the LI is a measure of the instability relative to the environment, but if the environmental lapse rate is not as steep as the parcel's, the CAPE could still be high. Maybe the LI is calculated with a different reference, or perhaps the data has some errors.</p>
<p>The freezing level is at 2951 meters, which is quite high. If a storm develops, the freezing level being high could mean that precipitation would be snow or freezing rain, but the WBZ is lower, so if the freezing level is below the WBZ, it could lead to freezing rain. However, the WBZ is 2307 meters, which is below the freezing level, so that might not be the case. Wait, the WBZ is the height where the wet bulb temperature reaches zero. If the freezing level is higher than the WBZ, then the precipitation would be supercooled, but if the freezing level is lower, then the precipitation could be freezing rain. However, the WBZ is 2307 m, and the freezing level is 2951 m, so the freezing level is higher than the WBZ. That would mean that the precipitation would be snow, as the WBZ is at a lower altitude. But if the freezing level is higher than the WBZ, then the precipitation would not reach the surface as freezing rain. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The WBZ is the height where the wet bulb temperature reaches 0°C. The freezing level is where the temperature reaches 0°C. So if the WBZ is lower than the freezing level, then the temperature is below 0°C above the WBZ, but the wet bulb temperature is also below 0°C. So, if the freezing level is higher than the WBZ, then the precipitation would be supercooled liquid water (freezing rain) if the freezing level is above the WBZ. Wait, no. If the freezing level is higher than the WBZ, that means the temperature is below 0°C above the WBZ, but the wet bulb temperature is also below 0°C. So, the precipitation would be supercooled, and if the freezing level is above the surface, then it would be freezing rain. But if the freezing level is above the WBZ, then the WBZ is at a lower height. Let me check: WBZ is 2307 m, freezing level is 2951 m. So the freezing level is higher than the WBZ. Therefore, the precipitation would be supercooled water, and if the freezing level is above the surface, then the precipitation would be freezing rain. But the freezing level is 2951 m, which is above the surface, so if the precipitation reaches the surface, it would be freezing rain. However, the WBZ is at 2307 m, so the wet bulb temperature reaches zero at that height. The temperature at the surface is 19°C, so the temperature profile is such that the freezing level is high. So, if a storm develops, the precipitation would be freezing rain. But the WBZ is lower than the freezing level, so the precipitation would be supercooled, leading to freezing rain. However, the LI is 1.9, which is not very negative, so maybe the instability is not sufficient for heavy precipitation. But the CAPE is high, so there's potential for strong updrafts.</p>
<p>Putting it all together: high CAPE (745 J/kg) indicates a lot of instability, but the LI is only 1.9, which is not very negative. The wind shear is present, especially with the upper-level jet at 250 hPa. The SRH values are moderate (76 and 107), which could contribute to rotation. The PW is 21.8 mm, which is moderate. The freezing level is high, so if precipitation occurs, it might be freezing rain. The CIN is negative (-391 J/kg), indicating no inhibition to convection.</p>
<p>But the LI is a bit confusing. Maybe the LI is calculated using a different method. Alternatively, perhaps the data is correct, and the CAPE is high but the LI is not as indicative. The key factors for severe weather are CAPE, wind shear, and instability. High CAPE with moderate wind shear could lead to thunderstorms, but the SRH values might not be high enough for tornadoes. However, the SRH is 76 and 107, which are in the range that could contribute to rotation, but not extremely high. So the potential for severe weather is moderate. The freezing level being high could lead to freezing rain if the storm is strong enough to bring precipitation to the surface.</p>
<p>But I need to check if the model data is reliable. The user mentioned that this is NWP model sounding data, so it's a forecast. However, the model might have some inaccuracies. To get a better assessment, I should check real-time data. The user provided tools: get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, get_upper_air_sounding. Since the model data is already given, maybe the surface observations would help confirm the current conditions. Also, radar imagery could show any ongoing convection, and satellite imagery could show cloud patterns. The upper air sounding is already provided, so maybe not necessary. But to confirm the surface conditions, get_surface_observations would be useful. Also, checking for any recent radar activity could indicate if there's already convection happening. So, I should make TOOL_CALLs for get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery to get more real-time data.<br />

<p><strong>Step-by-Step Reasoning:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surface Conditions:</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Temperature (19°C), Dew Point (10°C), and Wind (9 m/s from 151°):</strong> Indicates warm, moist air at the surface with light winds. The mixing ratio (mCN = -2) suggests a dry layer near the surface, which could limit moisture availability for convection.  </li>
<li><strong>CAPE (745 J/kg):</strong> High CAPE values (above 500 J/kg) indicate significant instability, which is a key ingredient for severe thunderstorms.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifted Index (LI = 1.9):</strong> Slightly positive, suggesting weak instability. However, this conflicts with the high CAPE. This discrepancy may arise because LI measures instability relative to a specific reference profile, while CAPE accounts for the entire atmospheric column.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind Shear and Rotation Potential:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Storm Relative Helicity (SRH1e = 76, SRH3e = 107):</strong> Moderate values suggest some potential for rotation, which could support tornado development if instability and lift are sufficient.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind Direction/Speed Changes:</strong> Wind direction shifts from south-southeast (surface) to southwest (250 hPa), indicating increasing wind shear with height. This enhances the likelihood of organized storm development.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moisture and Precipitation:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Precipitable Water (PW = 21.8 mm):</strong> Moderate moisture content, which supports precipitation but not extreme flooding.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freezing Level (2951 m):</strong> High freezing level implies that precipitation (if it occurs) would likely fall as snow or freezing rain, depending on the storm's intensity.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instability and Inhibition:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Convective Inhibition (CIN = -391 J/kg):</strong> Negative CIN indicates no significant inhibition to convection, allowing instability to manifest.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>LCL (1082 m):</strong> Low LCL suggests a shallow boundary layer, which could lead to rapid cloud development if lift is provided.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Gaps in Data:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Observations:</strong> The model data lacks current surface observations (e.g., recent precipitation, cloud cover) and radar/satellite imagery, which are critical for confirming convection initiation or ongoing severe weather.  </li>

Okay, let's tackle this NWP model sounding analysis for station ILX. The user wants a preliminary forecast focusing on severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. The data is from the RAP model at 06Z, valid at 0600Z. </p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding data includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction, and some severe weather indices. Let me start by looking at the surface observations. The surface level (sfc) has a temperature of 19°C and dew point of 10°C. The wind is from 151° (south-southeast) at 9 m/s. The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is slightly negative, indicating some instability. </p>
<p>Looking at the layers, the 850 hPa level has a temperature of 13°C and dew point 8°C. The 700 hPa level is much colder, with temperature 1°C and dew point -10°C. The 500 hPa is -17°C with a dew point of -40°C, and 250 hPa is -54°C with a dew point of -40°C. The temperature decreases rapidly with height, which is typical, but I need to check the lapse rates for instability.</p>
<p>The CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) isn't directly given, but the SRH1e and SRH3e values are 76 and 107, respectively. These are storm relative helicity values, which are important for tornado potential. The SRH1e is for the lowest 1 km, and SRH3e for the lowest 3 km. Higher values suggest a greater potential for rotation. </p>
<p>The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is just slightly negative. That might indicate a marginal instability. However, the LI is not the only factor. The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is relatively high, suggesting moisture content could be a factor. The FZLh (freezing level height) is 2951 meters, so freezing levels are around 3000 meters, which is above the surface. The WBZh (wet bulb zero height) is 2307 meters, indicating the height where the wet bulb temperature reaches zero. </p>
<p>The surface dew point is 10°C, and the 700 hPa dew point is -10°C. The dew point depression at the surface is 9°C, which is moderate. The lapse rate between the surface and 700 hPa is significant. The temperature at 700 hPa is 1°C, while the surface is 19°C. The lapse rate here is (19 - 1)/ (2848 m - 0) ≈ 6.3°C per 1000 m, which is a steep lapse rate, contributing to instability. </p>
<p>The wind shear is important for severe weather. The wind direction changes from 151° at the surface to 185° at 700 hPa, then 235° at 500 hPa. The wind speed increases with height, indicating a possible increase in wind shear. The SRH values suggest some helicity, which is good for tornadoes. </p>
<p>However, the LI is only 1.9, which is borderline. The CAPE isn't given, but I can estimate it using the sounding. The CAPE is the area between the parcel temperature and the environmental temperature. Since the LI is 1.9, which is close to zero, the CAPE might be low. However, the presence of high PW and some instability might still lead to thunderstorms. </p>
<p>The FZLh is 2951 meters, so any thunderstorms would have freezing levels around 3000 meters. The WBZh is 2307 meters, so the wet bulb temperature reaches zero at that height. The surface dew point is 10°C, which is above the dew point depression, so there's enough moisture. </p>
<p>The SHIP value is 0.9, which is the Showalter Index. A SHIP of 0.9 suggests some instability, but not very strong. The Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) height is 1082 meters, which is the height where the parcel becomes saturated. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) isn't directly given, but the LI is positive, so CIN might be low. </p>
<p>The wind shear values (SRH) are 76 and 107, which are moderate to high. The SRH1e is 76, which is a bit low for tornadoes, but SRH3e is 107, which is more significant. However, the LI is only 1.9, which might not be enough for strong updrafts. </p>
<p>I need to check if there's any other data that could help. The user mentioned that if additional data is needed, I should call the tools. The available tools include surface observations, radar, satellite, and upper air soundings. The current data is from the RAP model, but maybe the surface observations could confirm the current conditions. The get_surface_observations tool can fetch real-time data, which might show if the actual conditions are different from the model. Also, getting the latest radar imagery could show if there are any thunderstorms or severe weather already present. However, the model is valid at 0600Z, and the forecast is for 0700Z. Since the model is already at 0600Z, maybe the real-time data is not too far off. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the upper air sounding might have more data, but the given data is already from the model. So, the main thing is to check if the model's data is sufficient. The LI is borderline, but the SRH values and PW suggest some potential. However, the CAPE might be low. If the CAPE is low, even with some shear, the chance of severe weather is lower. </p>
<p>Wait, the model data might not have CAPE, but the LI is 1.9. The LI is calculated as the difference between the parcel temperature and the environmental temperature at the lifting condensation level. A positive LI means the parcel is warmer than the environment, leading to instability. A LI of 1.9 is slightly positive, indicating some instability. But the SRH is moderate. </p>
<p>So, the combination of some instability, moderate wind shear, and high PW might lead to thunderstorms, but not necessarily severe. However, the user is asking about severe weather potential. The SRH values are 76 and 107. The SRH1e is 76, which is a bit low for tornadoes, but SRH3e is 107, which is in the range that could support tornadoes. However, the LI is only 1.9, which might not be enough for a strong updraft. </p>
<p>I need to consider the other parameters. The PW is 21.8 mm, which is high, indicating a lot of moisture. The dew point at the surface is 10°C, which is moderate. The temperature lapse rates are steep, contributing to instability. The wind shear is present, which is good for rotation. </p>
<p>But without knowing the actual CAPE, it's hard to say. The model might not provide CAPE, but the LI is 1.9. If I can get the CAPE from another source, that would help. However, the available tools don't include CAPE directly. So, maybe I should call the get_surface_observations to check if the current conditions match the model. If the surface observations show a different dew point or temperature, that might affect the forecast. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the get_upper_air_sounding might provide more details, but the data given is already from the model. So, maybe the best approach is to make a preliminary assessment based on the given data. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the sounding shows some instability (LI 1.9), moderate wind shear (SRH), and high PW. However, the LI is just slightly positive, which might not be enough for strong convection. The severe weather potential is low to moderate, but not high. The freezing level is around 3000 meters, so any thunderstorms would be in the mid-levels. The SHIP is 0.9, which is not very strong. </p>
<p>But the user wants a forecast for 0700Z, which is just one hour after the model time. The model is valid at 0600Z, so the forecast is for a short time ahead. The conditions might not have changed much, so the assessment is based on the model's current state. </p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion is that there is a low to moderate potential for thunderstorms, but not severe. However, the presence of some instability and wind shear could lead to isolated thunderstorms. The severe weather potential is limited, but it's worth monitoring.<br />

<p><strong>FORECAST_SUMMARY:</strong><br />
The RAP model sounding indicates marginal instability (LI = 1.9) and moderate wind shear (SRH1e = 76, SRH3e = 107) with high precipitable water (21.8 mm). While conditions suggest potential for isolated thunderstorms, the weak CAPE and shallow lifting suggest limited severe weather risk. Freezing levels are at 2951 m, and surface moisture is adequate, but no strong updrafts are indicated. Real-time surface observations and radar imagery are recommended to confirm convective trends. Severe weather potential remains low, with a focus on weak to moderate thunderstorms.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

Okay, let's start by looking at the provided NWP model sounding data for station ILX (KSPI) from the RAP model. The data is valid at 0600Z on March 14, 2025, and we need to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z.</p>
<p>First, I'll parse the key parameters. The surface observations show a temperature of 19°C with a dew point of 10°C, which gives a dew point depression of 9°C. The wind is from 151 degrees (south-southeast) at 9 m/s. At 850 hPa, the temperature is 13°C, dew point 8°C, and wind is stronger at 25 m/s from 168 degrees (southwest). The 700 hPa level has a temperature of 1°C, dew point -10°C, and winds from 185 degrees (south) at 23 m/s. The 500 hPa level is -17°C with a dew point of -40°C, and 250 hPa is -54°C with a dew point of -40°C. </p>
<p>Looking at the lifted index (LI) of 1.9, which is slightly positive, suggesting marginal instability. The storm relative helicity (SRH) values are SRH1e=76 and SRH3e=107, which are moderate to high, indicating potential for rotation. The bulk shear (BS06) is 26 m/s, which is a strong wind shear. </p>
<p>The precipitable water (PW) is 21.8 mm, which is relatively high, contributing to moisture content. The convective available potential energy (CAPE) isn't directly given, but the LI and PW can help infer instability. The freezing level (FZLh) is at 2951 meters, which is relatively high, so thunderstorms might not reach the surface in colder regions. The wet bulb zero height (WBZh) is 2307 meters, which is lower than the freezing level, indicating that the atmosphere is moist enough to support thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The lapse rate (LR75) is -6.8°C per 100 meters, which is a steep lapse rate, contributing to instability. The Showalter index (SHIP) is 0.9, which is close to the threshold for convection. </p>
<p>Now, considering the parameters, the combination of moderate to high SRH, strong wind shear, and sufficient moisture suggests a potential for severe thunderstorms. The positive LI indicates some instability, but not extremely strong. However, the high PW and steep lapse rate could lead to thunderstorms. The freezing level is high, so if the storm develops, it might not produce hail, but could have strong updrafts. </p>
<p>I need to check if there are any other factors. The surface dew point depression is 9°C, which is not extremely high, but combined with the moisture from PW, it's enough. The wind shear is strong enough to support rotation. However, without real-time data like surface observations or radar, there might be uncertainties. </p>
<p>The user mentioned using tools if additional data is needed. So, I should suggest getting surface observations to confirm current conditions, radar for any existing storms, and satellite imagery for broader cloud patterns. Also, maybe another upper air sounding if the model data is insufficient. </p>
<p>Wait, the data provided is from the RAP model, so maybe the upper air sounding is already included. But to get the most current data, using get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery would help. Also, satellite imagery could show cloud cover. </p>
<p>So, the TOOL_CALLs would be for those tools. Then, based on the analysis, the forecast would mention potential for severe thunderstorms with strong wind shear and some instability, but not extreme. However, without real-time data, it's a preliminary assessment.<br />

<p><strong>Step-by-Step Analysis:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Surface Conditions:</strong><br />
   - Temperature: 19°C, Dew Point: 10°C (dew point depression = 9°C).<br />
   - Wind: 9 m/s from 151° (south-southeast).<br />
   - Moisture: High precipitable water (PW = 21.8 mm) indicates ample moisture.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instability Metrics:</strong>  </li>
<li>Lifted Index (LI = 1.9): Slight instability, marginally favorable for convection.  </li>
<li>Showalter Index (SHIP = 0.9): Near threshold for convection, suggesting potential for thunderstorms.  </li>
<li>
<p>Lapse Rate (LR75 = -6.8°C/100m): Steep lapse rate enhances instability.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind Shear:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Storm Relative Helicity (SRH1e = 76, SRH3e = 107): Moderate to strong shear, supportive of rotation and tornado potential.  </li>
<li>
<p>Bulk Shear (BS06 = 26 m/s): Strong directional wind shear, critical for supercell development.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freezing Level:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freezing Level (FZLh = 2951 m): High, limiting hail production but allowing for strong updrafts.  </p>

<p><strong>Moisture and Lift:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>PW and LI suggest sufficient moisture and lift for thunderstorm initiation.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Critical Gaps:</strong><br />
- <strong>Real-Time Observations:</strong> The model data lacks current surface observations (e.g., dew point, wind shifts) and radar/cloud patterns.<br />

<p><strong>FORECAST_SUMMARY:</strong><br />
Severe thunderstorms are possible around 0700Z on 03/14/2025, driven by moderate instability (LI = 1.9), strong wind shear (BS06 = 26 m/s, SRH = 107), and high PW (21.8 mm). While instability is marginal, the combination of shear and moisture suggests a risk for strong convective cells. However, high freezing levels (2951 m) may limit hail, and real-time data is needed to confirm storm development.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p><think><br />
Okay, let's tackle this weather analysis for station ILX. The user provided NWP model sounding data from the RAP model for 06Z on 03/14/2025, valid at 0600Z. The goal is to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z. </p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding data includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction at different pressure levels. Let me start by looking at the surface observations. The surface level (sfc) has a temperature of 19°C, dew point 10°C, so the relative humidity is around 65% (using the formula for RH, but maybe I should check if the data provides it directly). Wait, the data doesn't have RH, but I can calculate it if needed. However, the key parameters here are the temperature and dew point.</p>
<p>Looking at the temperature and dew point profiles. At the surface, the temperature is 19°C, dew point 10°C. The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is slightly positive. A positive LI usually indicates stable conditions, but I need to check the rest of the profile. </p>
<p>Next, the wind shear. The wind direction and speed at different levels: at 850hPa (1251 hPa height), wind is 168° at 25 kt. At 700hPa (2848 hPa height), wind is 185° at 23 kt. Then at 500hPa (5453 hPa height), wind is 235° at 21 kt. The wind shear here might be important for severe weather. The SRH1e is 76 and SRH3e is 107. These are storm relative helicity values. SRH1e is for 0-1 km, and SRH3e is 0-3 km. Both values are in the moderate range, which could contribute to rotation. </p>
<p>The Bulk Shear (BS06) is 26, which is the 0-6 km wind shear. The value is moderate, which is a factor in tornado development. </p>
<p>The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) isn't directly provided, but the LI is 1.9. However, the LI is calculated using the difference between the parcel temperature and the environmental temperature. Wait, the LI here is 1.9, which is a bit on the borderline. A positive LI (greater than 0) suggests that the atmosphere is stable, but if it's close to zero, it might be neutral. However, other parameters like the Showalter Index (sCP) is 18, which is a measure of stability. A Showalter Index of 18 is in the unstable range? Wait, the Showalter Index is calculated as the temperature difference between the surface and the lifting condensation level. Wait, no, the Showalter Index is the temperature of the parcel at the lifting condensation level (LCL) minus the environmental temperature at the LCL. Wait, the data has sCP as 18. Wait, maybe sCP is the Showalter Convective Parameter? I'm not sure. Let me check. The data includes sCP (probably Showalter Convective Parameter) as 18, which is a measure of instability. If that's positive, it indicates instability. However, the LI is 1.9, which is slightly positive. </p>
<p>But the Lifted Index (LI) is calculated as the difference between the temperature of a parcel lifted to 500hPa and the environmental temperature at 500hPa. Wait, no, the LI is typically calculated at the 500hPa level. Wait, the data's LI is 1.9, which is the value for the lifted index. A positive LI suggests that the atmosphere is stable, but if it's close to zero, it might be neutral. However, the value here is 1.9, which is slightly positive, indicating some stability. But maybe other factors like wind shear could still contribute to severe weather. </p>
<p>Looking at the parcel calculations. The LCL height is 1082 meters, which is the height where the parcel becomes saturated. The Convective Condensation Level (CCL) is 2307 meters (WBZh). Wait, the data has WBZh as 2307, which might be the level of free convection (LFC) or the buoyant level. Wait, the data has DCPk as 915, which could be the depth of the convective layer. But I need to check the parameters again. </p>
<p>The data also includes the Convective Inhibition (CIN) which is not directly provided here. Wait, the data has mCN as -2, which might be the moist convective inhibition. If that's negative, it indicates that there's some instability. Wait, the data has sCN as -391, which might be the surface-based convective inhibition. Wait, I'm getting confused with the parameters. Let me re-examine the data. </p>
<p>Looking at the parameters: sCP is 18 (maybe Showalter Convective Parameter), mCN is -2 (maybe moist convective inhibition), sCN is -391 (maybe surface-based convective inhibition). Wait, maybe the parameters are not standard. The data might be using different acronyms. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the data might have parameters like the Lifted Index (LI) which is 1.9, which is a measure of instability. However, if the LI is positive, it suggests that the atmosphere is stable. But the SRH values (76 and 107) are in the moderate to high range. High SRH can contribute to rotation and tornado development even if the CAPE is not extremely high. </p>
<p>The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is relatively high, indicating a moist environment, which is favorable for severe weather. The Lifted Index is 1.9, which is slightly positive, but in combination with high PW and moderate SRH, there might be potential for thunderstorms. </p>
<p>The wind profile shows increasing wind speeds with height, which is typical for a strong wind shear. The 0-6 km wind shear is 26 kt, which is moderate. The SRH1e (0-1 km) is 76, and SRH3e (0-3 km) is 107. These values are in the range that can support supercell development, which can produce severe weather like tornadoes. </p>
<p>However, the LI is 1.9, which is on the edge of instability. If the LI is slightly positive, it might not be enough for strong updrafts, but combined with high PW and wind shear, there's a possibility of thunderstorms. </p>
<p>But wait, the data's sCP is 18. If that's the Showalter Convective Parameter, which is calculated as the temperature of the parcel at the LCL minus the environmental temperature at the LCL. Wait, the LCL is 1082 meters. If the sCP is 18, that would mean the parcel is 18°C warmer than the environment at the LCL, which would indicate instability. But then the LI is 1.9, which is a different measure. </p>
<p>This might be conflicting. Maybe the model is using different parameters. If the sCP is positive, that suggests instability, but the LI is positive, which might indicate stability. This could be a contradiction. </p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the LI is calculated differently. Let me recall that the Lifted Index is the temperature of the parcel lifted to 500hPa minus the environmental temperature at 500hPa. If the LI is 1.9, that suggests that the parcel is 1.9°C warmer than the environment at 500hPa, which is a small positive value, indicating weak instability. </p>
<p>However, the SRH values and PW suggest that there's enough moisture and wind shear for severe thunderstorms. Even if the instability is marginal, the combination of moisture and shear could lead to severe weather. </p>
<p>The question is whether the model's parameters indicate a high enough potential for severe weather. The SRH1e and SRH3e are in the moderate to high range, which is favorable for supercells. The PW is high, indicating a moist environment. The wind shear is moderate. </p>
<p>But the LI is slightly positive, which might not be enough for strong updrafts. However, the presence of wind shear and moisture could still lead to thunderstorms, which might become severe if the instability is sufficient. </p>
<p>I need to check if there's any missing data that could help. For example, the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is not provided here. If CAPE is low, then even with shear, severe weather might not develop. But since the model data doesn't have CAPE, maybe the LI and SRH are the main indicators. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the model might have other parameters. For instance, the data includes the "mCN" as -2, which might be the moist convective inhibition. A negative value indicates that there's some instability, but if it's close to zero, it might not be enough. However, the sCN is -391, which might be the surface-based convective inhibition. Wait, that seems extremely negative. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the parameters. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the data might have other parameters. Let me check the parameters again. </p>
<p>The data includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>sCP: 18 (maybe Showalter Convective Parameter)</li>
<li>sCN: -391 (maybe Surface-based Convective Inhibition)</li>
<li>mCN: -2 (maybe Moist Convective Inhibition)</li>
<li>DCPk: 915 (maybe Depth of Convective Layer)</li>
<li>LI: 1.9 (Lifted Index)</li>
<li>PW: 21.8 (Precipitable Water)</li>
<li>SRH1e: 76 (Storm Relative Helicity 0-1 km)</li>
<li>SRH3e: 107 (Storm Relative Helicity 0-3 km)</li>
<li>FZLh: 2951 (Freezing Level Height)</li>
<li>WBZh: 2307 (Maybe Wet Bulb Zero Height or another parameter)</li>
<li>LR75: -6.8 (Maybe Lifted Index at 75% of the convective layer depth?)</li>
<li>SHIP: 0.9 (Supercell Hail Index?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait, SHIP is 0.9, which is the Supercell Hail Index. A value of 0.9 is on the lower side for supercells, but if combined with other factors, it might still be possible. </p>
<p>The FZLh is 2951 meters, which is the freezing level. If the freezing level is high, it might affect the development of hail. </p>
<p>Putting this all together: the model shows some instability (sCP=18, LI=1.9), moderate to high SRH, high PW, and moderate wind shear. However, the LI is slightly positive, which suggests weak instability. The SHIP is 0.9, indicating a low probability of supercells with hail. </p>
<p>But even with weak instability, the presence of wind shear and moisture could lead to thunderstorms. However, the potential for severe weather might be limited. </p>
<p>But the user is asking for a preliminary forecast assessment. Since the model data is from the RAP model, which is a high-resolution model, but the parameters might not capture all aspects. </p>
<p>To get a more accurate assessment, I should check for real-time data. For example, surface observations could provide current conditions, radar imagery for cloud cover and precipitation, satellite imagery for broader atmospheric patterns, and upper air soundings for more detailed profiles. </p>
<p>So, the next step is to request additional data. The user mentioned tools like get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, and get_upper_air_sounding. </p>
<p>First, check surface observations for current conditions. Then, radar imagery to see if there are any developing storms. Satellite imagery could show cloud patterns and moisture. Upper air soundings might provide more detailed profiles. </p>
<p>Therefore, I would make the following tool calls:</p>
<p>TOOL_CALL: get_surface_observations with parameters for station ILX and time around 0700Z.<br />
TOOL_CALL: get_latest_radar_imagery for ILX area and time around 0700Z.<br />
TOOL_CALL: get_satellite_imagery for ILX area and time around 0700Z.<br />
TOOL_CALL: get_upper_air_sounding for ILX and time around 0700Z.</p>
<p>These tools would provide more data to confirm the model's predictions and assess severe weather potential more accurately.<br />

Okay, let's start by looking at the provided NWP model sounding data for station ILX (KSPI) from the RAP model. The data is valid at 0600Z on March 14, 2025, and we need to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z. </p>
<p>First, I'll check the surface observations. The surface level shows a temperature of 19°C, dew point of 10°C, and a wind of 9 m/s from 151 degrees (southeast). The dew point depression is 9°C, which is moderate. The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is just above the threshold for some instability. However, the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) isn't directly given here, but the SRH values might be relevant.</p>
<p>Looking at the layers, the 700 hPa level has a temperature of 1°C and a dew point of -10°C. The 500 hPa level is much colder with -17°C and a dew point of -40°C. The wind shear values (SRH1e and SRH3e) are 76 and 107 m²/s², respectively. These values indicate some wind shear, which is important for tornado development. The bulk shear might be a factor here. </p>
<p>The Lifted Index (LI) of 1.9 suggests marginal instability. The Showalter Index (sCP) is 18, which is a bit high, indicating less instability. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) isn't provided directly, but the presence of a negative LI might suggest some inhibition. However, the SRH values are within the range that can support tornadoes if there's sufficient instability.</p>
<p>The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is relatively high, indicating moist air. The freezing level (FZLh) is at 2951 meters, which is about 9700 feet. That means if there's a thunderstorm, it could produce hail, but the freezing level isn't extremely high. The wet bulb zero temperature (WBZh) is at 2307 meters, which is lower than the freezing level, so there's a layer where the air is saturated and could contribute to hail formation.</p>
<p>The Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) is at 1082 meters, which is relatively low, meaning the atmosphere is unstable enough for convection to develop quickly. The most unstable parcel (mCP) is at 745 hPa, which is around 2848 meters. The deep convective instability (DCPk) is 915, which might be a measure of the strength of the updraft. </p>
<p>However, the lack of direct CAPE values is a concern. The SRH values are good for wind shear, but without CAPE, it's hard to assess the strength of the updrafts. Also, the surface dew point depression is 9°C, which is moderate, but the upper-level temperatures are very cold, which might not contribute much to instability. </p>
<p>I need to check if there are any other parameters that might indicate severe weather. The storm relative helicity (SRH) values are 76 and 107, which are in the range that can support tornadoes if the environment is right. However, the LI is only 1.9, which is on the borderline. The presence of a high PW and some instability might lead to thunderstorms, but the question is whether they'll be severe.</p>
<p>Since the model data is from RAP and the time is just before 0700Z, maybe there's a need to check real-time data to confirm the current conditions. The model might not have the latest observations. So, I should suggest getting surface observations and radar imagery to see if there's any current convection or wind shear patterns that could indicate severe weather. Also, satellite imagery could help assess cloud cover and moisture distribution.</p>
<p>Wait, the user mentioned that if additional data is needed, I should specify tools. The available tools are get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, and get_upper_air_sounding. Since the model data is already provided, but maybe the latest radar or surface observations could confirm current conditions. For example, if there's a storm system approaching or existing convection, that would affect the forecast. So, I should call get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery to check for any current convection or surface features that might influence the development of severe weather.<br />
</think></p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Reasoning:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surface Conditions:</strong>  </li>
<li>Surface temperature (19°C) and dew point (10°C) indicate a dew point depression of 9°C, suggesting moderate moisture. Wind (9 m/s from 151°) is light but from the southeast, which could be a precursor to storm development.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifted Index (LI = 1.9):</strong> Suggests marginal instability, just above the threshold for thunderstorm initiation (LI &lt; 0). However, this is not sufficient for severe thunderstorms without additional shear or CAPE.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vertical Profile Analysis:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>LCL (1082 m):</strong> Low LCL indicates a shallow boundary layer, which can lead to rapid convection development.  </li>
<li><strong>700 hPa (1°C, -10°C dew point):</strong> Significant temperature gradient between surface (19°C) and 700 hPa (1°C), contributing to instability.  </li>
<li><strong>500 hPa (-17°C, -40°C dew point):</strong> Extremely cold upper-level temperatures, which enhance instability by creating a strong temperature gradient.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>SRH1e (76 m²/s²) and SRH3e (107 m²/s²):</strong> These values indicate moderate to strong low- and mid-level wind shear, critical for tornado development.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moisture and Instability:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>PW = 21.8 mm:</strong> High precipitable water suggests ample moisture for thunderstorm development.  </li>
<li><strong>Freezing Level (2951 m):</strong> Indicates potential for hail if convection reaches this level.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>DCPk = 915:</strong> High deep convective instability, suggesting strong updrafts.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential Severe Weather:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The combination of marginal instability (LI = 1.9), moderate wind shear (SRH &gt; 70 m²/s²), and high PW creates a scenario where thunderstorms could develop. However, the LI is borderline, and without additional CAPE or CIN values, the severity is uncertain.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing Data:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy):</strong> Not provided in the sounding. CAPE is critical for assessing updraft strength and severe weather potential.  </li>
<li><strong>CIN (Convective Inhibition):</strong> Not provided, which could indicate whether the atmosphere is suppressing convection.  </li>

<p><strong>FORECAST_SUMMARY:</strong><br />
Severe weather potential is marginally present around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. The sounding indicates marginal instability (LI = 1.9), moderate wind shear (SRH1e = 76, SRH3e = 107), and high moisture (PW = 21.8 mm), which could support thunderstorms. However, without additional CAPE or CIN data, the likelihood of severe thunderstorms or tornadoes remains uncertain. Real-time surface observations and radar imagery are critical to confirm current convection and wind patterns.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user wants me to analyze the NWP model sounding data for station ILX, which is KSPI, from the RAP model on 20250314 at 06Z, valid at 0600Z. The goal is to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025.</p>
<p>First, I need to look at the data provided. The sounding data includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction at different pressure levels. Let me start by understanding each parameter and how they relate to severe weather.</p>
<p>Looking at the surface data: the temperature is 19°C, dew point 10°C. The temperature is a bit higher than the dew point, so there's some moisture, but not extremely high. The wind at the surface is 9 m/s from 151 degrees (southeast). The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is just above zero. That suggests some instability, but maybe not enough for severe weather. The convective available potential energy (CAPE) isn't directly given here, but the LI is a proxy. Wait, the data includes SRH1e and SRH3e, which are storm relative helicity values. SRH1e is 76 and SRH3e is 107. These are important for supercell development. Higher SRH values indicate more rotation potential.</p>
<p>The lifting condensation level (LCL) height is 1082 meters. That's the height where a parcel of air lifted from the surface would reach saturation. A lower LCL would indicate more instability. The dew point depression at the surface is 9°C (19-10), which is moderate. The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is relatively high, indicating a moist atmosphere. That's good for thunderstorm development.</p>
<p>Looking at the profile, the temperature at 850 hPa is 13°C, and the dew point is 8°C. The temperature at 700 hPa is 1°C, with a dew point of -10°C. The 500 hPa temperature is -17°C, dew point -40°C. The 250 hPa is -54°C. The temperature decreases rapidly with height, which is typical. The dew point is even lower at higher levels, which means the air is very dry above the boundary layer. This could indicate a strong temperature gradient, which might lead to instability.</p>
<p>The wind shear is important. The surface wind is from 151° (southeast), and at 850 hPa, it's 168°, which is more southwesterly. At 700 hPa, it's 185° (southwest), and at 500 hPa, 235° (west). The wind direction changes with height, which could indicate some shear. The SRH values are 76 and 107, which are moderate to high. Higher SRH is associated with more rotation, which is good for supercells. But the exact values need to be checked against typical thresholds. For example, SRH3e of 107 is above 100, which is often considered favorable for supercell development.</p>
<p>The wind speed increases with height. The surface wind is 9 m/s, 850 hPa is 25 m/s, 700 hPa is 23 m/s, 500 hPa is 21 m/s, and 250 hPa is 49 m/s. The wind speed is increasing with height, which is a sign of wind shear. However, the direction change isn't extremely sharp, but the SRH values suggest there's enough shear for rotation.</p>
<p>The lifted index (LI) is 1.9, which is just above zero. That means the atmosphere is slightly unstable. However, the LI is a measure of the buoyancy of a parcel lifted to the 500 hPa level. If the LI is slightly positive, it might not be enough for strong thunderstorms. But when combined with other parameters like SRH, it could still be favorable.</p>
<p>The storm relative helicity (SRH) values are 76 and 107. SRH1e is for the 0-1 km layer, and SRH3e is for 0-3 km. Both values are above 50, which is a threshold for supercell development. However, the exact threshold can vary. Higher SRH values (like 107) are more favorable for supercells.</p>
<p>The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is quite high. High PW indicates a moist environment, which is good for thunderstorm development. The mixing ratio at the surface is 10 g/kg (since dew point is 10°C, which corresponds to a mixing ratio of around 10 g/kg). The mixing ratio decreases with height, which is expected, but the dry air above the boundary layer could lead to a sharp lapse rate, contributing to instability.</p>
<p>The convective inhibition (CIN) isn't directly given here. The data includes the surface dew point and temperature, but without the CIN value, it's hard to assess if the atmosphere is inhibited. If CIN is low, then the instability can be realized. However, since the LI is slightly positive, maybe CIN is low enough.</p>
<p>The FZLh (freezing level height) is 2951 meters, which is quite high. That means the freezing level is above 2950 meters, which might not be ideal for hail development, as hail requires the freezing level to be lower. However, if the storm is strong enough, hail could still form, but the height might limit the size.</p>
<p>The WBZh (wet bulb zero height) is 2307 meters. This is the height where the wet bulb temperature reaches zero. This is related to the freezing level. The WBZh is lower than the FZLh, which is normal. The WBZh is 2307 meters, so the temperature at that level would be around -10°C, but since the dew point is much lower, the actual temperature might be even colder.</p>
<p>The LR75 is -6.8, which is the lapse rate between 700 and 500 hPa. A negative lapse rate means the temperature decreases with height, which is a stable condition. Wait, but the lapse rate is actually the rate at which temperature decreases with height. A higher lapse rate (more negative) indicates more instability. Wait, maybe I need to check. The LR75 is the lapse rate between 700 and 500 hPa. The temperature at 700 hPa is 1°C, and at 500 hPa it's -17°C. The temperature difference is -18°C over 2000 meters (from 700 to 500 hPa is about 2000 meters). The lapse rate is -18°C / 2000 m = -0.009°C/m, which is a very steep lapse rate. That's a high lapse rate, which contributes to instability. The LR75 is given as -6.8, which might be in units of °C per 100 m, so -6.8°C per 100 m, which is a very steep lapse rate. That would indicate strong instability, which is favorable for thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The SHIP (Showalter index) is 0.9, which is a measure of instability. A SHIP of 0.9 is slightly positive, indicating some instability. However, it's not very high. The Showalter index is calculated by lifting a parcel from the surface to the lifting condensation level, then to the 500 hPa level. If the SHIP is positive, the parcel is warmer than the environment at 500 hPa, leading to instability. So, a SHIP of 0.9 suggests some instability, but not extreme.</p>
<p>Putting this all together: The atmosphere has moderate instability (LI ~1.9, SHIP 0.9), sufficient moisture (PW 21.8 mm), and wind shear (SRH1e 76, SRH3e 107). The lapse rate is steep, which contributes to instability. However, the CAPE isn't directly given, so I can't calculate it. But with the SRH values and the instability, there's potential for thunderstorms. The SRH values are above the threshold for supercells, so there's a chance for supercell thunderstorms. However, the LI is just above zero, which might not be enough for strong updrafts. Also, the freezing level is high, which might limit hail size. But without CIN, it's hard to know if the instability is sufficient to overcome any inhibition.</p>
<p>Wait, the data includes the surface dew point and temperature, but no CIN. If the CIN is low, then the instability can develop. Since the LI is positive, maybe CIN is low. But without CIN, I can't be certain. Also, the SRH is important for rotation. The combination of instability and shear could lead to severe weather, such as tornadoes or large hail. However, the exact likelihood depends on other factors like the presence of a trigger (like a cold front or boundary).</p>
<p>But since the user is asking for a preliminary assessment, maybe I can conclude that there's a moderate chance of severe thunderstorms, possibly with rotation, given the SRH values and instability. However, without real-time data like surface observations or radar, I might miss some details. For example, the actual surface dew point might be different, or the wind shear might be more significant. So, to get a better assessment, I should check for surface observations and radar imagery to confirm the current conditions and any nearby boundaries that could trigger the storm development.</p>
<p>So, the next step would be to call the get_surface_observations tool to check the current surface conditions, like temperature, dew point, wind, and pressure. Also, get_latest_radar_imagery might show if there are any existing storms or boundaries. However, the user might not have real-time data, but the available tools are conceptual. Since the data is from a model, maybe the surface observations are already included. Wait, the data includes the surface layer (sfc), so maybe the surface observations are already in the data. However, the user might want to confirm with actual observations. Alternatively, the model data might not be accurate enough, so checking with real data would be better.</p>
<p>So, I should suggest using get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery to validate the model data and check for any current storm activity or boundaries that could trigger the development. Also, maybe get_upper_air_sounding again, but the data is already provided. So, the necessary tools would be get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery.</p>
<p>Wait, the tools available are get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, get_upper_air_sounding. Since the data is already provided from the upper air sounding, maybe the user wants to check for other data. So, the conclusion would be that the model data suggests potential for severe weather, but to confirm, surface observations and radar imagery are needed. However, the user might not have real-time data, but the assistant is supposed to specify the tools. Therefore, the answer should include the TOOL_CALL lines for get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery to get more accurate info.</p>
<p>But the user's data includes the surface data, so maybe the surface observations are already included. However, the model data might not be as accurate as real observations. So, to cross-verify, using the get_surface_observations tool would be appropriate. Similarly, radar imagery can show if there are any existing storms or boundaries that could trigger the thunderstorms.</p>
<p>So, the final forecast summary would mention the potential for thunderstorms with some rotation due to the SRH values and instability, but the exact severity depends on real-time data. Therefore, the assistant should call the tools to get more information.<br />

Okay, let's start by looking at the NWP model sounding data for station ILX (KSPI) from the RAP model. The valid time is 0600Z on 03/14/2025, and I need to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z.</p>
<p>First, I'll check the surface observations. The surface data shows a temperature of 19°C and dew point of 10°C. The dew point depression is 9°C, which is moderate. The wind is from 151 degrees (south-southeast) at 9 m/s. That's a light wind, but the direction might be important for moisture advection.</p>
<p>Looking at the lapse rates, the temperature decreases from 19°C at the surface to 1°C at 700 hPa (about 2848 meters). That's a steep lapse rate, which could indicate instability. The lifted index (LI) is 1.9°C, which is slightly positive, suggesting some instability but not extreme. However, the storm relative helicity (SRH) values are 76 for 1e and 107 for 3e. Higher SRH values indicate more potential for rotation, which is a key factor in severe thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The bulk shear (BS06) is 26 kt, which is moderate. This shear can contribute to storm rotation. The convective available potential energy (CAPE) isn't directly given, but the LI and SRH suggest that there's enough instability and shear for severe weather. The PW (precipitable water) is 21.8 mm, which is relatively high, indicating ample moisture. That's good for thunderstorm development.</p>
<p>The freezing level (FZLh) is at 2951 meters, so if clouds reach that height, there could be hail. The wet bulb zero height (WBZh) is 2307 meters, which is lower than the freezing level. This suggests that the atmosphere is moist enough for hail formation. The lifted index being slightly positive might not be enough for strong convection, but combined with the SRH and shear, there's a chance for severe weather.</p>
<p>Wait, the LI is 1.9°C, which is on the borderline. Typically, a LI less than 0°C is considered unstable. So 1.9 is just slightly positive. Maybe the model is indicating that there's some instability, but not a lot. However, the SRH values are higher, which can enhance the potential for rotation. The presence of high PW and moderate shear could lead to supercell thunderstorms, which can produce severe weather like large hail or tornadoes.</p>
<p>But I need to check if there's any other data missing. The sounding data provided is from the model, but real-time observations could give more accurate info. For instance, surface observations might have changed since the model run. So I should call get_surface_observations for ILX to check current conditions. Also, radar and satellite imagery could show any developing storms. However, the user mentioned the time is 0600Z, and the forecast is for 0700Z, which is just an hour later. Maybe the model data is already the latest, but to be thorough, getting real-time data would help confirm.</p>
<p>So, I'll make TOOL_CALLs for get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery. Wait, the user's instructions say to specify the tools if additional data is needed. The available tools are get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, get_upper_air_sounding. Since the data given is from the model sounding, but the user wants a preliminary assessment, real-time observations might be necessary. So, I'll call get_surface_observations for ILX to check if the current conditions match the model data. Also, maybe check radar for any existing storms that could influence the forecast.</p>
<p>So, the steps would be: check surface observations for current conditions, check radar for any developing storms, and maybe satellite imagery for broader weather patterns. However, the user might not have real-time data available, but according to the problem statement, I need to specify the tools if needed. So, I'll include those tool calls.<br />

Okay, let me try to work through this. The user provided NWP model sounding data for station JKL, and they want a preliminary forecast for severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. </p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding is from the RAP model at 06Z, valid for 0600Z. The data includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction at different pressure levels. Let me look at each level.</p>
<p>Starting with the surface layer (sfc): pressure 975 hPa, temperature 15°C, dew point 11°C. The wind is from 180° (south) at 3 m/s. The relative humidity can be calculated, but maybe I don't need that. The Lifted Index (LI) is 1.7, which is borderline unstable. The Showalter Index (sCP) is 0, and the Most Unstable Convective Available Potential Energy (MUCAPE) is 23? Wait, no, looking at the parameters: sCP is 0, mCP is 23. Wait, maybe mCP is the most unstable CAPE? Or maybe I need to check the parameters again. The data includes LI (Lifted Index) as 1.7, which is slightly positive, indicating weak instability. </p>
<p>Then the 850 hPa level: temperature 11°C, dew point 2°C. Wind is 170° at 7 m/s. The 700 hPa level: temp -1°C, dew point -8°C. Wind is 265° at 8 m/s. At 500 hPa: temp -18°C, dew point -30°C. Wind is 248° at 11 m/s. 250 hPa: temp -52°C, dew point -30°C. Wind is 296° at 45 m/s. </p>
<p>Looking for instability indicators. The LI is 1.7, which is just above zero, so maybe weak instability. The SRH1e and SRH3e values are 43 and 92, which are storm relative helicity values. Higher values indicate more potential for rotation. The SRH3e is 92, which is above 50, suggesting a possible mesocyclone. </p>
<p>The Bulk Shear (BS06) is 14, which is the 0-6 km shear. The value is moderate, maybe around 10-15 is considered moderate. That could contribute to tornado potential if combined with other factors. </p>
<p>The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) isn't directly given, but the LI is 1.7, which is low. However, the SRH values are high. Wait, maybe the model is using different parameters. The data also includes PW (precipitable water) as 18.1 mm, which is a bit high, indicating moist air. </p>
<p>The FZLh (freezing level height) is 2596 meters, and WBZh (wet bulb zero height) is 2219 meters. These are the heights where the temperature drops to 0°C and wet bulb temperature drops to 0°C. The freezing level is higher than the wet bulb zero level, which is typical. </p>
<p>The Lapse Rate (LR75) is -6.7, which is the lapse rate between 700 and 500 hPa. A negative lapse rate means the temperature is decreasing with height, which is normal. But the steepness of the lapse rate could affect instability. </p>
<p>Now, considering the parameters for severe weather. The SRH3e is 92, which is a high value, suggesting strong storm-relative helicity. Combined with the BS06 of 14, which is moderate shear, this could indicate a favorable environment for tornadoes. However, the CAPE is low (since LI is 1.7, which is weak), but maybe there's other factors. </p>
<p>Wait, the LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive, but the model might have other parameters. The PW is 18.1 mm, which is a lot of moisture, so that could support thunderstorms. The temperature profile shows a steep lapse rate in the lower levels, which could lead to strong updrafts. </p>
<p>But the CAPE isn't directly given. Wait, maybe I can calculate it using the temperature and dew point profiles? Or maybe the model already has some CAPE value. However, in the data provided, the parameters include LI, SRH, etc., but not CAPE. So maybe the LI is the main indicator here. </p>
<p>If the LI is 1.7, that's weak instability, but the SRH is high. So even with weak CAPE, the high shear and moisture could lead to supercell development. However, without higher CAPE, the severity might be limited. </p>
<p>But the user is asking for severe weather potential. So, the combination of high SRH and moderate shear could lead to tornadoes, but the CAPE is low. Maybe the model is using different parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the model's SRH values are higher than the CAPE, which could still lead to some severe weather. </p>
<p>The wind shear (BS06) is 14, which is moderate. The SRH values are 43 and 92, which are higher than typical thresholds for tornado potential. So, the environment might be favorable for tornadoes, but the CAPE is low. However, maybe the model is considering other factors. </p>
<p>Wait, the data also includes the lifting condensation level (sLCLh) at 541 meters. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) isn't directly given, but the sCP is 0, which might indicate no inhibition. </p>
<p>So, putting it all together: the model shows a weakly unstable atmosphere with some moisture, high storm-relative helicity, and moderate wind shear. This combination could lead to the development of supercells with potential for tornadoes, even with low CAPE. However, the lack of strong CAPE might limit the intensity. </p>
<p>But the user is asking for a preliminary assessment. So, maybe the model data suggests some severe weather potential, but it's not certain. However, without real-time data, it's hard to say. The user might need to check real-time observations for more accurate assessment. </p>
<p>So, the next step would be to check for real-time surface observations, radar, and satellite imagery. The get_surface_observations tool could provide current surface conditions, like wind, temperature, dew point, pressure, which could help confirm the model's data. Also, radar imagery might show any developing thunderstorms or rotation. Satellite imagery could show cloud patterns that indicate severe weather. </p>
<p>Therefore, I should call the get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, and get_satellite_imagery tools. Wait, but the user might not have all these tools available. Wait, the available conceptual tools are get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, get_satellite_imagery, and get_upper_air_sounding. Since the model data is already provided, maybe the upper air sounding is already included. </p>
<p>But to get a more accurate assessment, the tools would be necessary. So, the response should include TOOL_CALLs for those tools. </p>
<p>So, the final forecast summary would mention the potential for severe weather, such as tornadoes, based on the high SRH and moderate shear, but with some uncertainty due to low CAPE. However, the user needs to verify with real-time data.<br />
</think></p>
<p>The provided NWP model sounding data for station JKL (0600Z, 20250314) indicates a complex atmospheric environment with potential for severe weather. Here's the step-by-step analysis:  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instability Assessment</strong>:  </li>
<li><strong>Lifted Index (LI)</strong>: 1.7 (slightly positive, weak instability).  </li>
<li><strong>Moisture</strong>: Precipitable water (PW) is 18.1 mm, indicating a moist layer.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lapse Rate</strong>: The LR75 (-6.7°C/km) suggests a steep lapse rate between 700 and 500 hPa, which could enhance convective instability.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shear and Rotation</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Storm-Relative Helicity (SRH)</strong>: SRH1e = 43, SRH3e = 92 (high values, favorable for mesocyclone development).  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bulk Shear (BS06)</strong>: 14 m/s (moderate 0–6 km shear, enhancing tornado potential when combined with SRH).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thermodynamic Profile</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Freezing Level (FZLh)</strong>: 2596 m (high, suggesting cold air aloft).  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Surface Conditions</strong>: Surface dew point (11°C) and temperature (15°C) indicate a moist boundary layer.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Severe Weather Potential</strong>:<br />
   The combination of high SRH (92), moderate shear (BS06 = 14), and moisture (PW = 18.1 mm) suggests a favorable environment for supercell thunderstorms. However, weak CAPE (implied by LI = 1.7) may limit storm intensity. The steep lapse rate and moist layer could still support tornadoes, though confidence is moderate.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Critical Gaps</strong>:<br />
- <strong>Real-Time Observations</strong>: The model data lacks recent surface observations, radar, or satellite data to confirm current storm development or environmental changes.  </p>
<p><strong>TOOL_CALL</strong>:<br />
TOOL_CALL: {"tool_name": "get_surface_observations", "arguments": {"station_id": "JKL", "time": "20250314/0700"}}<br />

TOOL_CALL: {"tool_name": "get_satellite_imagery", "arguments": {"location": "JKL", "time": "20250314/0700"}}  </p>
<p><strong>FORECAST_SUMMARY</strong>: Severe weather potential exists around 0700Z on 03/14/2025, with a moderate risk of tornadoes due to high storm-relative helicity (SRH3e = 92), moderate 0–6 km shear (BS06 = 14), and moist air (PW = 18.1 mm). However, weak instability (LI = 1.7) may limit storm intensity. Real-time data is critical to confirm storm development and adjust the forecast.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

Okay, let's tackle this weather analysis for station JKL. The user wants to know about severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025 using the RAP model sounding data from 06Z. </p>
<p>First, I need to go through the provided sounding data step by step. Let me start by understanding each parameter. The station is at 314 meters elevation. The surface observations show temperature 15°C, dew point 11°C, so the dew point depression is 4°C. Wind is from 180° at 3 m/s. </p>
<p>Looking at the layers: 850 hPa has temperature 11°C, dew point 2°C. The 700 hPa layer has temp -1°C, dew point -8°C. The 500 hPa is -18°C with dew point -30°C. The 250 hPa is -52°C. </p>
<p>The key parameters for severe weather are SRH (Storm Relative Helicity), which here is SRH1e 43 and SRH3e 92. Higher SRH values indicate more potential for rotation, which is good for severe thunderstorms. The LI (Lifted Index) is 1.7, which is near the threshold for thunderstorm development (usually LI &lt; 0 is considered severe). </p>
<p>The Convective Inhibition (CIN) is not directly given, but the values of sCN and mCN might relate to it. Wait, the data shows sCN 0 and mCN -16. Maybe those are the convective available potential energy (CAPE) values? Or perhaps they are different parameters. Wait, in the data, sCP is 0 and mCP is 23. Maybe sCP is surface-based CAPE and mCP is most unstable CAPE? Not sure. But the SRH values are high, which is good for rotation. </p>
<p>The PW (Precipitable Water) is 18.1 mm, which is quite high, indicating a moist atmosphere, which is favorable for heavy precipitation. The FZLh (Freezing Level height) is 2596 meters, which is around 2.6 km. The WBZh (Wet Bulb Zero Height) is 2219 meters. </p>
<p>Looking at the lapse rates: The temperature decreases from 15°C at the surface to -1°C at 700 hPa (which is about 2744 meters), then to -18°C at 500 hPa (around 5340 meters). The lapse rate between surface and 700 hPa is (15 - (-1)) = 16°C over 2744 meters, which is a steep lapse rate. The lapse rate between 700 hPa and 500 hPa is (-1 - (-18)) = 17°C over 2656 meters, which is also steep. </p>
<p>The CAPE is not directly given here, but the SRH is high. The LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive, indicating some instability, but not extremely so. However, with high SRH and PW, there could be a chance for severe thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Wait, the SRH values: SRH1e is 43 and SRH3e is 92. These are for 1 and 3 km layers, respectively. Higher SRH values in the lower levels can contribute to tornado potential. The LI is 1.7, which is on the edge of being unstable. The PW is high, so moisture is good. </p>
<p>The wind shear is also important. The wind at 850 hPa is 170° at 7 m/s, and at 700 hPa is 265° at 8 m/s. The change in wind direction and speed with height indicates some shear. The 250 hPa wind is 296° at 45 m/s, which is very strong. </p>
<p>But to confirm the severe weather potential, I need to check if there's enough CAPE. Since the data doesn't explicitly provide CAPE, maybe the SRH and LI can be used in conjunction. However, the LI is only 1.7, which is not extremely high. But with high SRH and PW, there might still be some risk. </p>
<p>Wait, the data includes "LR75": -6.7. I'm not sure what LR75 stands for. Maybe it's the 75th percentile lapse rate? Or something else. If it's a negative value, it might indicate a stable layer. But without more context, it's hard to say. </p>
<p>The user might need additional data to confirm the CAPE and other parameters. For example, the CAPE is crucial for determining the potential for strong updrafts. Since the model data doesn't include CAPE directly, perhaps the SRH and LI are the main indicators here. </p>
<p>But to get a more accurate assessment, I should check the surface observations and maybe the radar or satellite imagery. However, the user has provided the sounding data, so maybe the analysis can proceed with the given data. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the absence of CAPE in the data might mean that the model didn't calculate it, or it's not part of the provided parameters. In that case, the SRH and LI are the main factors. The high SRH values suggest potential for rotation, and the LI is slightly positive, which could indicate some instability. </p>
<p>The high PW (18.1 mm) means there's a lot of moisture, which is good for heavy rain, but not necessarily severe thunderstorms unless combined with instability. The freezing level is around 2.6 km, which is relatively low, so hail could be possible if the storm is strong enough. </p>
<p>Considering all these factors, there's a possibility of severe weather, especially with the high SRH and PW, but the LI is only slightly positive. The convective inhibition (CIN) isn't provided, so it's unclear if the atmosphere is inhibiting convection. If there's low CIN, then the instability could lead to thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Since the user is asking for a preliminary assessment, and the data shows some signs of instability and shear, but not extremely high CAPE, I might need to mention that the potential exists but requires further data. However, the user might need to check for additional tools like surface observations, radar, or satellite imagery to confirm. </p>
<p>Wait, the data includes surface observations. The surface temperature and dew point are given, so maybe the CIN can be inferred. If the surface dew point is 11°C, and the temperature is 15°C, the dew point depression is 4°C. But without knowing the CAPE or CIN, it's hard to say. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the sounding suggests some potential for severe weather due to high SRH and PW, but the LI is only slightly positive. To confirm, I might need to check for real-time data like surface observations or radar, but the provided data is limited. However, the user might not have access to those tools, so the forecast summary should note the potential based on available data.<br />

<p><strong>Step-by-Step Reasoning:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surface Conditions:</strong>  </li>
<li>Temperature (15°C) and dew point (11°C) at the surface indicate a dew point depression of 4°C, suggesting moderate moisture content. Wind is light (3 m/s) from the south (180°).  </li>
<li>
<p>Precipitable water (PW = 18.1 mm) is high, indicating a moist atmosphere favorable for heavy precipitation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifted Index (LI = 1.7):</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A positive LI (close to 0) suggests weak instability. However, combined with high PW, it could still support thunderstorm development, especially if lifted by an upslope or frontal mechanism.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storm Relative Helicity (SRH):</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SRH1e = 43 and SRH3e = 92 indicate significant low-level (1 km) and mid-level (3 km) helicity, which are critical for tornado genesis and rotating thunderstorms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind Shear and Lapse Rates:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>Wind direction shifts from southerly (170°) at 850 hPa to westerly (265°) at 700 hPa, with increasing wind speeds (7–8 m/s). This suggests moderate vertical wind shear, enhancing storm organization.  </li>
<li>
<p>The steep lapse rate between surface (15°C) and 700 hPa (-1°C) indicates instability, though the LI is only marginally positive.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freezing Level and Moisture:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freezing level at 2596 m (2.6 km) suggests potential for hail if storms develop. High PW supports heavy rainfall, but no indication of extreme convective inhibition (CIN) is present.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing Parameters:</strong>  </p>

Severe weather potential is moderate around 0700Z on 03/14/2025.

Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user wants me to analyze the NWP model sounding data for station JKL, specifically looking at severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. The data provided is from the RAP model at 06Z, valid for 0600Z. </p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding data includes various parameters like temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction, pressure, and some indices like SRH, LI, PW, etc. Let me start by looking at the key parameters that indicate severe weather potential. </p>
<p>The first thing I notice is the Lifted Index (LI) is 1.7. That's a bit on the borderline for convection. Typically, a LI of 0 or lower is considered unstable, but 1.7 is slightly positive. However, sometimes models can have discrepancies, so maybe the actual conditions are different. </p>
<p>Then there's the Showalter Index (sCP) and the Most Unstable CAPE (mCP) and mCN. Wait, the data shows sCP as 0, mCP as 23, and mCN as -16. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the parameters. Let me check the units. The sCP is 0, which might be the Showalter Convective Inhibition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the parameters are different. </p>
<p>Looking at the temperature and dew point profiles. At the surface (sfc), the temperature is 15°C, dew point 11°C. At 850hPa (around 1160m), temperature is 11°C, dew point 2°C. Then at 700hPa (2744m), temperature is -1°C, dew point -8°C. At 500hPa (5340m), temperature is -18°C, dew point -30°C. And at 250hPa (10160m), temp -52°C, dew point -30°C. </p>
<p>So the temperature decreases with height, but the dew point decreases more rapidly, especially at higher levels. The dew point at 250hPa is -30°C, which is quite low. The mixing ratio at each level would be important for instability. </p>
<p>Looking at the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). Wait, the data mentions SRH1e (storm relative helicity at 1e) as 43 and SRH3e as 92. These are measures of helicity, which relates to the potential for rotation. Higher values indicate more potential for supercell development. </p>
<p>The PW (precipitable water) is 18.1 mm, which is a significant amount of moisture. High PW is associated with more instability and potential for heavy rainfall. </p>
<p>The Lifted Index (LI) is 1.7, which is slightly positive. That suggests some instability, but not extremely strong. However, the presence of high PW and SRH values might indicate that even a slight instability could lead to severe weather. </p>
<p>The Free Convective Layer (FCL) height is 2596 meters, which is the height where the parcel becomes warmer than the environment. The level of free convection (LFC) is at 2219 meters. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) is 0, which is unusual. Wait, the data shows sCN as -16. Maybe that's the Convective Inhibition? If it's negative, that means there's less inhibition, so the parcel can rise more easily. </p>
<p>Wait, the parameters might be a bit confusing. Let me check the data again. The parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sCP: 0</li>
<li>mCP: 23</li>
<li>mCN: -16</li>
<li>SRH1e: 43</li>
<li>SRH3e: 92</li>
<li>LI: 1.7</li>
<li>PW: 18.1</li>
<li>FZLh: 2596</li>
<li>WBZh: 2219</li>
<li>LR75: -6.7</li>
<li>STP: 0.0</li>
<li>SHIP: 0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming that sCP is the Showalter Convective Inhibition (CIN), mCP is the Most Unstable CAPE, and mCN is the Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) or something else. Wait, maybe the parameters are different. For example, mCP could be the most unstable CAPE, and mCN could be the convective inhibition. But the values here are conflicting. If mCN is -16, that would imply negative convective inhibition, which means there's no inhibition, so the parcel can rise. </p>
<p>But the LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive. So there's some instability, but not a lot. However, the SRH values are 43 and 92, which are relatively high. SRH is important for rotation, which can lead to tornadoes. </p>
<p>The PW of 18.1 mm is quite high, which suggests a lot of moisture. That combined with some instability could lead to heavy rain and maybe thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Now, considering the temperature and dew point profiles. The dew point at the surface is 11°C, which is a bit high for the temperature of 15°C, but the dew point decreases rapidly with height. At the surface, the mixing ratio is (using the dew point temperature), but without exact formulas, it's hard to calculate. However, the dew point at 250hPa is -30°C, which is very low. </p>
<p>The CAPE can be estimated using the temperature and dew point profiles. Since the LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive, but the presence of high SRH and PW might indicate that even a small amount of instability could lead to severe weather. </p>
<p>But the question is about severe weather potential. The SRH values (43 and 92) are in the range that could support rotation. The PW is high, so there's a lot of moisture. The LI is slightly positive, which is not a strong indicator, but combined with other factors, it could be enough. </p>
<p>However, the Convective Inhibition (CIN) being -16 (assuming that's the case) suggests that there's no inhibition, so the parcel can rise. The LI is 1.7, which is just above zero, so the parcel would start to rise. </p>
<p>But the problem is that the LI is not very strong. However, the presence of high SRH and PW could lead to thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Now, I need to check if there are any other parameters that might indicate severe weather. The LR75 is -6.7, which might be the lifted index at 75% of the troposphere. Wait, not sure. The STP is 0.0, which could be the storm top pressure. SHIP is 0.0, which is the severe hail index. </p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the parameters are different. For example, the mCP is 23, which could be the most unstable CAPE. If that's the case, then 23 J/kg is low, but not sure. </p>
<p>Wait, in typical NWP data, CAPE values are usually in the range of 1000-2000 J/kg for strong thunderstorms. But if mCP is 23, that seems too low. Maybe the units are different? Or perhaps the data is scaled. Alternatively, the mCP might be the most unstable CAPE in some other unit. </p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the parameters are not CAPE but something else. The data might have some inconsistencies. </p>
<p>But given the available data, the key points are: </p>
<ul>
<li>High SRH values (43 and 92) which are good for rotation.</li>
<li>High PW (18.1 mm) for moisture.</li>
<li>LI of 1.7, slightly positive, but not very strong.</li>
<li>CIN is -16 (if that's convective inhibition), which means no inhibition.</li>
<li>The temperature and dew point profiles show a steep lapse rate, which could lead to instability. </li>
</ul>
<p>But without knowing the exact units for mCP and mCN, it's hard to say. However, the SRH values are high enough to consider rotation potential. </p>
<p>So, the conclusion would be that there's a possibility of thunderstorms with some rotation (tornado potential) due to high SRH and moisture, but the instability is only slightly positive. However, the presence of high PW and SRH could lead to severe weather. </p>
<p>But to be sure, maybe I should check the actual surface observations and radar imagery. For example, if there are any recent reports of thunderstorms or wind shear. </p>
<p>So, the next step would be to call get_surface_observations to check for recent weather conditions at the station, and get_latest_radar_imagery to see if there are any existing thunderstorms or wind patterns that could contribute to severe weather. </p>
<p>Also, maybe get_upper_air_sounding for more detailed data, but the data provided is already a sounding. </p>
<p>So, the TOOL_CALLs would be get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery. </p>
<p>Wait, but the user said to include TOOL_CALLs if additional data is needed. Since the current data is from the model, but the user is asking for a preliminary assessment, maybe the surface observations and radar imagery could provide real-time data that the model might not capture. </p>
<p>Therefore, I should make those calls.<br />

<p><strong>Step-by-Step Reasoning:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Instability Assessment:</strong>  </li>
<li>The Lifted Index (LI) is <strong>1.7</strong>, indicating marginal instability. While slightly positive, it suggests the potential for weak convection.  </li>
<li>The Convective Inhibition (CIN) is <strong>-16</strong> (assumed from <code>mCN</code>), implying no significant inhibition to lift air, which could allow instability to develop.  </li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>PW (Precipitable Water)</strong> is <strong>18.1 mm</strong>, indicating a high moisture content, which supports heavy rainfall and enhances storm development.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shear and Rotation Potential:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>SRH1e (43)</strong> and <strong>SRH3e (92)</strong> values are elevated, suggesting strong storm-relative helicity. These values are indicative of potential for rotation (e.g., supercells or tornadoes).  </li>
<li>
<p>Wind profiles show increasing wind speeds with height (e.g., 45 kt at 250hPa), contributing to vertical wind shear, a key ingredient for severe thunderstorms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lapse Rates and CAPE:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>The temperature decreases rapidly with height (e.g., from 15°C at the surface to -52°C at 250hPa), creating a steep lapse rate.  </li>
<li>
<p>While the <strong>Most Unstable CAPE (mCP)</strong> is <strong>23 J/kg</strong> (low for severe storms), the combination of high moisture and shear could still lead to isolated severe thunderstorms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Uncertainties:</strong>  </p>
</li>
<li>The <strong>LI</strong> is marginal, and <strong>CAPE</strong> values are low, which may not support widespread severe weather. However, the presence of high SRH and moisture increases the risk of isolated tornadoes or large hail.  </li>
<li>Surface observations and real-time radar data are needed to confirm instability and verify storm development.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TOOL_CALLS:</strong><br />
TOOL_CALL: {"tool_name": "get_surface_observations", "arguments": {"station_id": "KJKL", "time_range": "20250314/0600-0700Z"}}<br />

<p><strong>FORECAST_SUMMARY:</strong><br />
Severe weather potential is low but not ruled out. Marginal instability (LI=1.7) combined with high precipitable water (18.1 mm) and elevated storm-relative helicity (SRH=92) suggests a risk of isolated thunderstorms with possible rotation (tornado potential) around 0700Z. However, weak CAPE (23 J/kg) and low convective inhibition (-16) may limit widespread severe weather. Real-time surface and radar data are critical for confirmation.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user wants me to analyze the NWP model sounding data for station JKL, specifically looking at severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. The data provided is from the RAP model at 06Z, valid for 0600Z. </p>
<p>First, I need to understand the data. The sounding data includes various parameters at different pressure levels. Let me start by looking at the key parameters related to severe weather. The parameters listed include things like Lifted Index (LI), Showalter Index (sCP and sCN?), but wait, looking at the data, sCP and sCN might be the Showalter and K-index? Wait, the parameters here are a bit confusing. Let me check the data again.</p>
<p>The data has entries like sCP: 0, sCN: 0, mCP: 23, mCN: -16. Maybe those are the Showalter and K-index? Or perhaps the Convective Inhibition (CIN) and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)? Wait, the parameters in the sounding data include "sLCLh" which is the lifting condensation level height, "DCPk" which might be the depth of the convective inhibition, "BS06" which is the 0-6 km bulk shear, "SRH1e" and "SRH3e" which are the 1 and 3 km storm relative helicity, "PW" for precipitable water, "LI" for Lifted Index, "FZLh" which is the freezing level height, "WBZh" the wet bulb zero height, and "LR75" which is the 75th percentile of the lapse rate. </p>
<p>So, the LI is 1.7, which is the Lifted Index. A positive LI indicates stable conditions, but values around 1-2 might be on the borderline. However, the SRH values are 43 and 92, which are the storm relative helicity for 1 and 3 km. Higher SRH values can indicate potential for rotation, which is a key factor in severe thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Looking at the wind shear: BS06 is 14 m/s, which is the 0-6 km bulk shear. That's a significant value, suggesting strong wind shear, which is important for tornado development. </p>
<p>The precipitable water (PW) is 18.1 mm, which is relatively high, indicating a moist atmosphere, which can contribute to heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms. </p>
<p>The freezing level (FZLh) is at 2596 meters, which is about 8500 feet. That means if thunderstorms develop, they might reach the freezing level, leading to hail. </p>
<p>The Lifted Index (LI) is 1.7, which is slightly positive. Typically, a LI less than -2 is considered unstable, but 1.7 suggests some instability, but not extremely. However, the SRH values are high, so even with moderate instability, the wind shear could lead to severe weather. </p>
<p>Looking at the temperature profiles: At the surface, the temperature is 15°C, dew point 11°C. The dew point depression is 4°C, which is moderate. At 850 hPa (1160 m), temperature is 11°C, dew point 2°C. At 700 hPa (2744 m), temperature is -1°C, dew point -8°C. At 500 hPa (5340 m), temp -18°C, dew point -30°C. At 250 hPa (10160 m), temp -52°C. </p>
<p>So, the temperature decreases rapidly with height, but the dew point decreases even more, leading to a very dry layer in the upper atmosphere. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) is not directly given, but the "DCPk" is 497. Wait, maybe "DCPk" is the depth of the convective inhibition? If that's the case, a higher value might indicate more inhibition, but I need to check. Alternatively, maybe "DCPk" refers to something else. </p>
<p>Wait, the parameters listed are "sCP" and "mCP" which might be the Showalter and K-index? Wait, looking up typical sounding parameters, the K-index is a measure of instability, and the Showalter index is another. But the data here has sCP and mCP. Maybe those are the Showalter and K-index? For example, sCP could be the Showalter index (s for Showalter?), and mCP is the K-index? If sCP is 0, that might indicate very unstable conditions, but I need to verify. </p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps "sCP" and "mCP" are the surface and mid-level convective parameters. However, without more context, it's a bit challenging. </p>
<p>Assuming that the LI is 1.7, which is marginal instability. However, the presence of high SRH (43 and 92) and high PW (18.1) could still lead to severe thunderstorms. The wind shear (BS06=14 m/s) is also significant. </p>
<p>Another parameter is the Storm Relative Helicity (SRH) at 1 and 3 km. SRH1e is 43 and SRH3e is 92. These values are above the threshold for tornado potential, especially when combined with sufficient CAPE. </p>
<p>But wait, the CAPE isn't directly given here. However, the LI is 1.7, which is a measure of CAPE. A positive LI suggests some CAPE, but not very high. However, the SRH values are high, which could lead to supercell development even with moderate CAPE. </p>
<p>The freezing level is at 2596 m, so if the storm reaches that height, hail could form. </p>
<p>The PW is 18.1 mm, which is relatively high, contributing to heavy rainfall. </p>
<p>Now, considering the wind profile: The wind direction changes with height. At the surface, wind is from 180° (south), 7 m/s. At 850 hPa (1160 m), wind is 170° (southwest), 7 m/s. At 700 hPa (2744 m), wind is 265° (west-southwest), 8 m/s. At 500 hPa (5340 m), wind is 248° (west), 11 m/s. At 250 hPa (10160 m), wind is 296° (northwest), 45 m/s. </p>
<p>The wind shear is significant, especially in the lower levels. The 0-6 km shear is 14 m/s, which is a key factor for tornado development. </p>
<p>The LR75 is -6.7, which is the 75th percentile of the lapse rate. A negative value indicates a stable lapse rate, which might suggest that the atmosphere is stable in the mid-troposphere, but the lower levels have some instability. </p>
<p>So, combining these factors: moderate instability (LI 1.7), high SRH, strong wind shear, high PW, and a freezing level. This suggests that there's a potential for severe thunderstorms, possibly with tornadoes, especially if the CAPE is sufficient. However, the LI is on the borderline of instability. </p>
<p>But wait, the LI is 1.7, which is just above zero. Typically, a LI of -1 to -2 is considered unstable, but 1.7 is neutral. However, in the presence of strong wind shear and high PW, the storm could still develop. </p>
<p>But maybe there's a need to check the actual CAPE. Since CAPE is not directly provided, perhaps the model data is missing that parameter. Alternatively, the SRH values and other parameters could be used to infer. </p>
<p>Another thing to consider is the dew point depression. The surface dew point is 11°C, and the temperature is 15°C, so a dew point depression of 4°C. At 850 hPa, the dew point is 2°C, temp 11°C, so dew point depression of 9°C. At 700 hPa, dew point is -8°C, temp -1°C, so dew point depression of 7°C. At 500 hPa, dew point is -30°C, temp -18°C, so dew point depression of 12°C. </p>
<p>The dry air in the mid-troposphere could lead to a rapid decrease in dew point, which might not be conducive for precipitation but could affect the storm's development. </p>
<p>So, the combination of high wind shear, moderate instability, high PW, and freezing level suggests that there's a potential for severe weather, including thunderstorms with hail, possible tornadoes, and heavy rain. However, the LI is marginal, so it's not certain. </p>
<p>But the user is asking for a preliminary assessment. Given the data, the model sounding indicates that there's a possibility of severe weather. However, without real-time observations, there's uncertainty. </p>
<p>The next step is to check if additional data is needed. For example, surface observations could provide more details on current conditions. The radar imagery could show if there are any developing thunderstorms. Satellite imagery might show cloud patterns. Also, the upper air sounding is already provided, but maybe the model's upper air data is not sufficient. </p>
<p>But the user's data already includes the upper air sounding. However, to confirm the actual conditions, perhaps real-time surface observations are needed. So, the tool call would be get_surface_observations for station JKL. </p>
<p>Alternatively, if there's a need to check for any existing thunderstorms or cloud cover, get_latest_radar_imagery and get_satellite_imagery could be useful. But since the time is 0600Z, and the forecast is for 0700Z, which is just a hour later, maybe the radar and satellite data would show current conditions, which could indicate if any storm development is happening. </p>
<p>So, the tools needed would be get_surface_observations to check current surface conditions, get_latest_radar_imagery to see if there are any storms, and get_satellite_imagery for cloud patterns. </p>
<p>Wait, but the user specified the data is from the RAP model, so maybe the model data is already the best available. However, to confirm, the assistant should check if real-time data is needed. Since the model is a forecast, the actual conditions might differ. </p>
<p>Therefore, the assistant should recommend getting surface observations and radar imagery to validate the model's predictions. </p>
<p>So, the TOOL_CALLs would be:</p>
<p>get_surface_observations for station JKL to check current surface conditions like temperature, dew point, wind, pressure, etc.</p>
<p>get_latest_radar_imagery for the area around JKL to see if there are any developing thunderstorms or precipitation.</p>
<p>get_satellite_imagery for the region to check cloud cover and patterns that might indicate storm development.</p>
<p>But the user's instructions say to output each tool call as a line in the exact format. So, each tool call would be a separate line. </p>
<p>But the assistant should decide which tools are necessary. Given that the model data is already provided, but real-time data could confirm or refute the model's forecast. </p>
<p>Therefore, the assistant would call get_surface_observations, get_latest_radar_imagery, and get_satellite_imagery. </p>
<p>Then, after analyzing the real-time data, the forecast summary would be made. </p>
<p>But since the user wants the initial analysis based on the model data, the assistant would first present the reasoning based on the given data, then suggest the necessary tools. </p>
<p>So, the final forecast summary would mention the potential for severe weather based on the model data, but with the caveat that real-time data is needed for confirmation.<br />

<p><strong>Reasoning Process:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Instability Analysis:</strong> The Lifted Index (LI) is <strong>1.7</strong>, indicating <strong>marginal instability</strong> (neutral to slightly unstable). While this is not strongly unstable, it suggests the potential for thunderstorms.<br />
2. <strong>Wind Shear:</strong> The <strong>0-6 km bulk shear (BS06)</strong> is <strong>14 m/s</strong>, a significant value that supports <strong>rotating thunderstorms</strong> (e.g., supercells).<br />
3. <strong>Storm Relative Helicity (SRH):</strong> SRH1e (<strong>43</strong>) and SRH3e (<strong>92</strong>) are above thresholds for <strong>tornado potential</strong>, especially when paired with sufficient instability.<br />
4. <strong>Moisture Content:</strong> Precipitable water (<strong>PW = 18.1 mm</strong>) is high, enhancing <strong>heavy rainfall and hail</strong> potential.<br />
5. <strong>Freezing Level:</strong> The <strong>freezing level (FZLh = 2596 m)</strong> implies hail could form if storms reach that height.<br />
6. <strong>Temperature Profile:</strong> Rapid temperature decreases with height (e.g., from 15°C at the surface to -52°C at 250 hPa) suggest <strong>strong vertical wind shear</strong> and <strong>dry mid-troposphere</strong>, which can enhance storm organization.<br />
7. <strong>Convective Inhibition (CIN):</strong> The "DCPk" value (<strong>497</strong>) might indicate <strong>moderate convective inhibition</strong>, but without explicit CIN values, this remains uncertain.  </p>
<p><strong>Critical Uncertainties:</strong><br />
- The LI is marginal, and without explicit CAPE values, instability might not be sufficient for severe thunderstorms.<br />
- Surface observations and real-time radar/satellite data are needed to confirm current conditions and storm development.  </p>

Okay, let's tackle this sounding analysis for station JKL. The user wants to know about severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. First, I need to go through the data step by step.</p>
<p>Starting with the surface data: the temperature is 15°C, dew point 11°C. The dew point depression is 4°C, which isn't too high, so maybe not a lot of moisture. The wind is from 180° at 3 kt, which is south-southeast, but not too strong. The lifted index (LI) is 1.7, which is slightly negative. Wait, the LI is a measure of atmospheric instability. A positive LI means stable, negative means unstable. So 1.7 is actually slightly positive, which suggests some instability. But maybe I should check the exact values again. The LI is 1.7, which is close to zero, so maybe there's a slight chance of convection.</p>
<p>Looking at the other parameters: the Showalter index (sCP) is 0, which is a measure of instability. A value of 0 might indicate a very stable atmosphere. But the K-index is 23, which is a bit high. The K-index is used to predict thunderstorms. A value over 20 suggests a high chance of thunderstorms. So that's a red flag. The SRH1e and SRH3e are 43 and 92, respectively. These are storm relative helicity values. Higher values indicate more potential for rotation, which can lead to severe weather like tornadoes. So SRH3e being 92 is quite high, which is a good indicator.</p>
<p>The PW (precipitable water) is 18.1 mm. That's a significant amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which can contribute to heavy rainfall. The lifted index is 1.7, which is on the edge of being unstable. The FZLh is 2596 meters, which is the freezing level height. If the freezing level is around 2600 meters, that might affect the type of precipitation, but since we're looking at 0700Z, maybe there's potential for hail if the storm reaches that height.</p>
<p>Looking at the upper levels: the 500 mb level has a temperature of -18°C, and the 250 mb has -52°C. The wind shear is present, especially between the 700 and 500 mb levels. The wind direction changes from 265° at 700 mb to 248° at 500 mb, which is a slight change. But the SRH values are high, so that's a good sign for rotation.</p>
<p>Wait, the 700 mb temperature is -1°C, and the 500 mb is -18°C. The temperature gradient here could indicate instability. The dew point temperatures at 700 mb is -8°C, and at 500 mb is -30°C. The mixing ratio is low, but with the moisture content from the surface (PW 18.1 mm), there might be enough moisture to develop thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The storm relative helicity values (SRH1e and SRH3e) being 43 and 92 suggest that there's a lot of helicity, which is good for tornado development. However, the SRH3e is a bit high. The SRH1e is also above 30, which is a threshold for supercell development.</p>
<p>Now, considering the lifting condensation level (LCL) is at 541 meters. The CAPE (convective available potential energy) isn't directly given, but the LI is 1.7. Since LI is a measure of CAPE, a positive value here might not indicate high CAPE. Wait, but the K-index is 23, which is a better indicator of instability. The K-index is calculated using several parameters, including the 700 mb temperature, 850 mb temperature, and the surface temperature and dew point. A K-index over 20 suggests thunderstorms, so that's a key point.</p>
<p>However, the CAPE isn't provided, so I can't directly calculate it. But with the SRH values and K-index, there's a potential for severe weather. The PW is high, which means there's a lot of moisture available, which is necessary for heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. The SRH values are high enough to support rotation, which could lead to tornadoes.</p>
<p>But wait, the LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive. That might indicate that the atmosphere is just barely unstable. However, the K-index is 23, which is a strong indicator. So maybe the combination of moisture, instability, and wind shear is enough to support severe weather.</p>
<p>The user might need real-time data to confirm the current conditions. For example, if the surface observations show any changes in wind or temperature, or if there's a nearby storm system. Also, radar and satellite imagery could show if there's any developing convection. So, I should suggest getting surface observations, radar, and satellite data to validate the model output.</p>
<p>So, the tools to call would be get_surface_observations for current conditions, get_latest_radar_imagery to check for any developing storms, and get_satellite_imagery for broader cloud patterns. The upper air sounding is already provided, but maybe the user wants to check for any discrepancies.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, the forecast summary would mention the potential for thunderstorms with high SRH and K-index, possible hail due to freezing level height, and the need for real-time data to confirm.<br />

Okay, let's tackle this NWP model sounding analysis for station JKL. The user wants a preliminary forecast for severe weather around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. Let me start by going through the data step by step.</p>
<p>First, looking at the sounding data from the RAP model. The station is KJKL with coordinates 37.59°N, -83.32°W, elevation 314 meters. The valid time is 0600Z, so we need to assess the conditions just before 0700Z.</p>
<p>Starting with the surface observations. The surface level (sfc) has pressure 975 hPa, temperature 15°C, dew point 11°C. The wind is 180° at 3 m/s, which is from the south. The dew point depression is 4°C (15-11), indicating fairly dry air at the surface. The lifted index (LI) is 1.7°C, which is close to the threshold for thunderstorm development. Typically, a LI below -2°C is considered unstable, but 1.7 is on the edge. However, other parameters might contribute to instability.</p>
<p>Next, looking at the 850 hPa level. Pressure is 850 hPa, height 1160 meters, temperature 11°C, dew point 2°C. Wind is 170° at 7 m/s. The dew point here is quite low, which suggests dry air in the lower troposphere. The temperature here is 11°C, which is a bit warm for that level. The mixing ratio might be low, contributing to a dry layer.</p>
<p>At 700 hPa, pressure is 700 hPa, height 2744 meters, temperature -1°C, dew point -8°C. Wind is 265° at 8 m/s. The temperature here is below freezing, and the dew point is even lower. The lapse rate between 850 and 700 hPa could be significant. The lifted index might be influenced by the temperature profile here.</p>
<p>The 500 hPa level has pressure 500 hPa, height 5340 meters, temperature -18°C, dew point -30°C. Wind is 248° at 11 m/s. This is a very cold layer, indicating a strong temperature gradient. The dew point here is extremely low, suggesting a very dry upper troposphere.</p>
<p>The 250 hPa level is at 10160 meters, temperature -52°C, wind 296° at 45 m/s. This is a high wind speed, which could indicate a jet streak, but the temperature is very cold. The wind shear between 250 and 500 hPa might be important for storm development.</p>
<p>Looking at the parameters provided: SRH1e is 43 and SRH3e is 92. These are storm relative helicity values. SRH1e is for the 0-1 km layer, and SRH3e is for 0-3 km. Higher values indicate more potential for rotation, which is good for supercells. The SRH3e of 92 is quite high, which is favorable for tornado development. However, the SRH1e is 43, which is moderate. </p>
<p>The PW (precipitable water) is 18.1 mm, which is a decent amount of moisture. The LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive, but not extremely unstable. However, the presence of high SRH values and moisture could still lead to thunderstorms, especially if other instability parameters are considered. </p>
<p>The FZLh (freezing level height) is 2596 meters, which is about 8500 feet. That means the freezing level is relatively high, which could affect precipitation type. The WBZh (wet bulb zero height) is 2219 meters, indicating the height where the wet bulb temperature reaches zero. </p>
<p>The Lifting Condensation Level (LCL) height is 541 meters, which is the height where the parcel becomes saturated. The Convective Inhibition (CIN) is 23 (mCP) and -16 (mCN), which might be a typo. Wait, the data shows "sCP": 0, "sCN": 0, "mCP": 23, "mCN": -16. I think "sCP" might be surface-based convective precipitation, but the labels are a bit unclear. However, the "mCP" and "mCN" could be convective parameters. If "mCP" is convective inhibition, then 23 J/kg would indicate some inhibition, but the "mCN" is -16, which might be the convective available potential energy (CAPE). Wait, CAPE is usually positive, so maybe "mCN" is CAPE. If so, -16 J/kg would be negative, indicating stable conditions. But that conflicts with the SRH values. Maybe there's confusion in the parameters. Alternatively, "mCP" could be the convective parameter, and "mCN" is the convective inhibition. If "mCN" is -16, that would suggest very low inhibition, allowing convection to develop. </p>
<p>Wait, the data has "mCP": 23 and "mCN": -16. Maybe "mCP" is CAPE and "mCN" is CIN. If CAPE is 23 J/kg, that's very low, but the SRH values are high. That doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe "mCP" is the convective parameter (like CAPE) and "mCN" is the convective inhibition. If CAPE is 23 J/kg, that's not much, but the SRH is 92. That might not be enough for severe weather. However, the LI is 1.7, which is on the borderline. </p>
<p>Wait, the SRH3e is 92, which is quite high. That suggests strong helicity, which is good for tornadoes. But the CAPE might be low. However, the PW is 18.1, which is high moisture. So even if CAPE is low, the combination of moisture and helicity could lead to severe thunderstorms. </p>
<p>Looking at the temperature profile, from the surface up to 250 hPa, the temperature decreases rapidly. The lapse rate between the surface and 850 hPa is about 15°C (surface) to 11°C at 850 hPa, which is a lapse rate of around 0.5°C per 100 meters. Then from 850 to 700 hPa, the temperature drops from 11 to -1°C over 1644 meters, which is a steep lapse rate. This could indicate instability. The CAPE might be calculated based on this. However, the data doesn't provide CAPE directly, but the SRH and LI are given. </p>
<p>The presence of high SRH and moisture (PW) could lead to supercell development. The FZLh is 2596 meters, so if the storm develops, it might produce hail. The WBZh is 2219 meters, which is lower than the FZLh, suggesting that the wet bulb temperature reaches zero at 2219 meters, which is below the freezing level. This might affect the precipitation type. </p>
<p>But the LI is 1.7, which is slightly positive, indicating some instability. However, the convective inhibition might be low. If the CAPE is low, but the helicity is high, the storm could still develop. Also, the wind shear between different levels is important. The wind at 850 hPa is 170°, 7 m/s, and at 250 hPa is 296°, 45 m/s. The wind direction changes with height, indicating wind shear, which is necessary for storm rotation. </p>
<p>So, putting it all together: the sounding shows a mix of some instability (LI 1.7, SRH3e 92), moisture (PW 18.1), and wind shear. However, the CAPE might be low. Without knowing the exact CAPE value, it's hard to say. The presence of high SRH and moisture could lead to severe thunderstorms, possibly with tornadoes. But the CAPE might not be sufficient. </p>
<p>I need to check if there are any other parameters. The data includes "LR75": -6.7, which might be the 700 hPa lapse rate. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be the 75th percentile of the lapse rate. </p>
<p>If the CAPE is low but the SRH is high, the storm might be weak but with rotation. Alternatively, if the CAPE is sufficient, then the combination could lead to severe weather. Since the LI is on the edge, maybe the storm is possible but not certain. </p>
<p>However, the user wants a preliminary forecast. Since the SRH3e is 92, which is high, and the moisture is good, there's potential for severe weather. But the CAPE might be low. To confirm, maybe I should get the actual CAPE value. But the data provided doesn't include CAPE. The parameters given are SRH1e, SRH3e, LI, PW, etc. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the presence of high SRH and moisture could lead to supercell development even with moderate CAPE. So, the forecast would be a potential for severe thunderstorms, possibly with tornadoes, but the exact severity depends on other factors. </p>
<p>Since the user is asking for a preliminary assessment, I should mention the potential for severe weather based on the given data. However, to be more accurate, I might need to check the CAPE or other parameters. But since the data doesn't have CAPE, perhaps the SRH is a better indicator here. </p>
<p>Therefore, the forecast summary would indicate a potential for severe thunderstorms with possible tornadoes, given the high SRH and moisture. But I should also mention that the LI is on the borderline, so it's not certain. </p>
<p>Wait, the user might need additional tools. For example, getting surface observations, radar imagery, satellite imagery, or another sounding. Since the data is from the RAP model, maybe the model's resolution is sufficient, but real-time data could confirm the conditions. </p>
<p>So, the next step is to check if the current model data is sufficient or if real-time data is needed. The user's data is from the RAP model, which is a high-resolution model. However, to confirm the current conditions, getting surface observations and radar imagery could help. </p>
<p>Therefore, I should make TOOL_CALLs for get_surface_observations and get_latest_radar_imagery to verify the current conditions and check for any developing storms. Also, maybe get_satellite_imagery for broader cloud patterns. </p>
<p>But the user's question is about the NWP sounding data. However, the user might want to cross-validate with real-time data. So, I'll suggest using the tools to get surface observations and radar imagery. </p>
<p>So, the reasoning would involve checking the parameters, noting the high SRH and moisture, and then suggesting the tools to get more data for confirmation.<br />
</think></p>
<p>The analysis of the RAP model sounding data for station JKL (37.59°N, -83.32°W) at 0600Z reveals several key meteorological parameters that suggest potential for severe weather around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surface Conditions</strong>:  </li>
<li><strong>Temperature (15°C)</strong>, <strong>dew point (11°C)</strong>, and <strong>dew point depression (4°C)</strong> indicate dry air at the surface.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind (180° at 3 m/s)</strong> is light, but the low dew point depression suggests limited moisture availability for immediate convection.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifted Index (LI = 1.7°C)</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Slightly positive LI (threshold for thunderstorms is typically &lt; -2°C), indicating marginal instability. However, this is influenced by the shallow layer of instability in the lower troposphere.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind Shear and Helicity</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>SRH1e = 43</strong> and <strong>SRH3e = 92</strong> (storm relative helicity) are notably high, especially SRH3e. These values suggest strong low-level wind shear and potential for storm rotation, favorable for supercell development.  </li>
<li>
<p>Wind direction changes with height (e.g., 170° at 850 hPa to 296° at 250 hPa) indicate a significant vertical wind shear, critical for tornado formation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moisture Profile</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Precipitable Water (PW = 18.1 mm)</strong> is high, providing ample moisture for thunderstorm development.  </li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>freezing level (2596 m)</strong> is relatively high, which could lead to hail if storms develop.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature and Stability</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>Rapid temperature decreases with height (e.g., from 15°C at the surface to -52°C at 250 hPa) suggest a steep lapse rate, enhancing instability.  </li>
<li>
<p><strong>Convective Inhibition (CIN)</strong> is unclear from the data, but the presence of high SRH and moisture implies that any inhibition may be overcome by the available energy.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Uncertainties</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li><strong>CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy)</strong> is not explicitly provided, which is a direct measure of instability. Without CAPE, the exact severity of thunderstorms remains uncertain.  </li>
<li>Surface observations and real-time radar imagery could confirm current conditions and identify any developing storms.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</li>

Okay, let's tackle this sounding analysis for station JKL. The user wants to know about severe weather potential around 0700Z on 03/14/2025. First, I need to go through the data step by step.</p>
<p>Starting with the surface observations. The surface data shows a temperature of 15°C, dew point 11°C, so the dew point depression is 4°C. That's not super high, but not too low either. Wind is from 180° at 3 m/s, which is south-southeast, light winds. The lifted index (LI) is 1.7, which is just above the threshold for convection. Usually, LI below -2 indicates potential for thunderstorms, so 1.7 is on the borderline. Maybe some instability, but not sure yet.</p>
<p>Looking at the profile. The 850 hPa level has a temperature of 11°C, dew point 2°C. The 700 hPa level is -1°C with dew point -8°C. The 500 hPa is -18°C, dew point -30°C. The 250 hPa is -52°C. The lapse rates here... The temperature decreases with height, but how about the stability? The most unstable parcel (mCP) is 23°C, which is the surface temperature. Wait, the surface temperature is 15°C, so maybe the mCP is the lifted parcel temperature? Wait, mCP is the temperature of the most unstable parcel at the surface? Or is that the convective temperature? Hmm, maybe I need to check the parameters. The data includes sLCLh (lifted condensation level height) at 541 meters, which is about 540 meters AGL. The DCPk is 497 meters, which might be the depth of the convective inhibition? Wait, DCPk is the depth of the convective inhibition layer? Or maybe the convective available potential energy (CAPE)? Wait, the parameters are a bit unclear. Let me think again.</p>
<p>The key parameters for severe weather are CAPE, shear, and instability. The SRH1e is 43 and SRH3e is 92. These are the storm relative helicity values. SRH1e is for the 0-1 km layer, and SRH3e for 0-3 km. Higher values indicate more rotation potential. 43 and 92 are moderate to high, which could support tornadoes or strong thunderstorms. The PW (precipitable water) is 18.1 mm, which is relatively high, indicating moist air, which is good for thunderstorm development. The LI is 1.7, which is marginal for convection. But the SRH values are high, so even if the LI is just above zero, the shear could help trigger storms.</p>
<p>The lifted condensation level (LCL) is at 541 meters. The CAPE might be calculated from the temperature and dew point profiles. The temperature decreases rapidly from the surface to the 700 hPa level. The 850 hPa temp is 11°C, and the 700 hPa is -1°C. The dew point at 850 is 2°C, and at 700 is -8°C. The lapse rate between 850 and 700 hPa is pretty steep. That might indicate some instability. But without CAPE values, it's a bit hard to tell. The model data might have other parameters like K-index or Showalter index, but the given data doesn't have those.</p>
<p>The wind shear is important. The wind at the surface is 180° at 3 m/s, 850 hPa is 170° at 7 m/s, 700 hPa is 265° at 8 m/s, 500 hPa is 248° at 11 m/s. So the wind direction is changing from south to southwest to northwest as we go up. The shear from surface to 700 hPa is a significant change in direction, which could be conducive for rotation. The 0-3 km SRH is 92, which is a good value for supercells. </p>
<p>The FZLh (freezing level) is 2596 meters, so the freezing level is high, which might mean that if thunderstorms develop, they could produce hail. The WBZh is 2219 meters, which is the level of maximum buoyancy. The LR75 is -6.7, which might be the 75th percentile of the layer, but I'm not sure. </p>
<p>Putting it all together: high SRH values, moderate PW, marginal LI, and some instability. The combination of shear and moisture could lead to thunderstorms. However, the LI is just above zero, so the trigger might be important. If there's a trigger like a cold front or wind shear, the storms could develop. Since the model data is from 06Z, valid at 0600Z, and the target time is 0700Z, the time is very close. So the conditions are just developing. </p>
<p>But wait, the LI is 1.7, which is weak instability. However, the SRH values are high. In some cases, even with weak instability, strong shear can lead to supercells. So the potential for severe weather exists, especially if there's a trigger. The high PW (18.1 mm) is good for heavy rain, but not sure about hail. The freezing level is 2596 meters, so hail could form if the storms reach that level. </p>
<p>But I need to check if there's any missing data. The model data doesn't include CAPE directly, so maybe the SRH and LI are the main indicators. Also, the ship (severe hail index) is 0.0, which might not be a factor. The STP (storm top pressure) is 0.0, which could indicate something else. </p>
<p>Since the data is from the RAP model, maybe the SRH and LI are the key. The user is asking for severe weather potential, so I should consider the possibility of thunderstorms with rotation, maybe hail. However, without surface observations for the time period, maybe I should check for real-time data. The user mentioned that if additional data is needed, to call the tools. So, perhaps the surface observations around 0700Z could be checked with get_surface_observations, and radar or satellite imagery for current conditions. </p>
<p>So, the reasoning is that the model data shows high shear and moisture, but weak instability. The potential for severe thunderstorms exists, especially if a trigger is present. To confirm, maybe check surface observations for wind changes or pressure systems, and radar for any developing storms. Therefore, I should call get_surface_observations for the area around 0700Z and get_latest_radar_imagery to check for any developing storms.<br />

Okay, let's start by looking at the provided NWP model sounding data for station JKL. The data is from the RAP model, valid at 0600Z on 2025-03-14. The goal is to assess severe weather potential around 0700Z.</p>
<p>First, I'll parse the data. The station's elevation is 314 meters. The surface observations show a temperature of 15°C, dew point of 11°C, and a wind of 180 degrees (south) at 3 m/s. The dew point depression (td) is 4°C, which isn't too high, so maybe some moisture but not extremely humid. The lifted index (LI) is 1.7, which is close to the threshold for convection. Typically, an LI of 0 or lower indicates potential for thunderstorms. So 1.7 is slightly above that, but maybe it's marginal.</p>
<p>Looking at the layers, the 850hPa level has a temperature of 11°C and dew point of 2°C. The 700hPa level has a temperature of -1°C and dew point of -8°C. The 500hPa is -18°C with a dew point of -30°C. The 250hPa is -52°C with a dew point of -30°C. The wind shear parameters SRH1e is 43 and SRH3e is 92. These are the storm relative helicity values. SRH1e (for the 0-1 km layer) is 43, which is on the higher side. SRH3e (for 0-3 km) is 92, which is quite high. High SRH values are associated with supercell thunderstorms. </p>
<p>The bulk shear is also a factor here. The wind direction changes from 180 at the surface to 265 at 700hPa, then 248 at 500hPa. The wind speed increases with height, which indicates some vertical shear. The presence of high SRH and shear could support rotation in thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The lifted index (LI) is 1.7, which is slightly positive but close to the threshold. The convective available potential energy (CAPE) isn't directly given, but the LI and SRH suggest some instability and shear. The PW (precipitable water) is 18.1 mm, which is relatively high, indicating a moist atmosphere. The FZLh (freezing level height) is 2596 meters, so freezing levels are around 2600 meters. The WBZh (wet bulb zero height) is 2219 meters, which is lower, suggesting the atmosphere is moist enough to have a significant wet bulb zero height. </p>
<p>The lapse rate at 75% relative humidity (LR75) is -6.7°C per 100m, which indicates a stable lapse rate. Wait, but that might not be the right way to interpret it. Maybe the LR75 is the moist adiabatic lapse rate? Or is it the actual lapse rate? If the LR75 is negative, that might imply a stable atmosphere. But the presence of high PW and some instability from the LI could mean that there's a mix of stability and potential for convection. </p>
<p>The surface dew point depression is 4°C, which isn't extremely high, but combined with the PW, it's possible that there's enough moisture for thunderstorms. The SRH values are high, which is a good sign for severe weather. However, the LI is slightly positive, so maybe the instability is marginal. </p>
<p>I need to check if there's any other parameter that might indicate severe weather. The surface winds are from the south, which might be part of a larger system. The upper-level winds are strong at 250hPa (45 m/s), which could be part of a jet stream that's contributing to wind shear. The presence of a strong jet stream can enhance vertical wind shear and potentially trigger thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Since the LI is slightly positive and SRH is high, there's potential for severe thunderstorms. However, without more real-time data, like surface observations or radar, I can't be certain. The model data might not capture the exact conditions, especially if there's a developing system. So, I should suggest getting real-time data to confirm the current conditions. </p>
<p>Possible tools to use: get_surface_observations to check current surface conditions, get_radar_imagery for any developing storms, and get_upper_air_sounding for more detailed atmospheric profiles. Wait, the data provided is already from the model sounding, but maybe the latest upper air data could be different. However, the user provided the model data, so perhaps the available tools are the ones to call for additional data. </p>
<p>So, I should make TOOL_CALLs for get_surface_observations and get_radar_imagery to check for any current storm activity and surface conditions. Also, maybe get_upper_air_sounding again, but the data is already provided. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to confirm with real-time data. </p>
<p>In conclusion, based on the model data, there's a potential for severe thunderstorms due to high SRH and slightly positive LI, but the exact forecast needs real-time data to confirm.<br />
</think></p>
<p>The provided RAP model sounding data for station JKL (37.59°N, -83.32°W) at 0600Z on 2025-03-14 shows a marginal but plausible setup for severe weather. Here's the analysis:</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step Reasoning:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Surface Conditions</strong>:  </li>
<li>Temperature (15°C) and dew point (11°C) indicate a dew point depression of 4°C, suggesting moderate moisture.  </li>
<li>
<p>Surface winds (180°/3 m/s) are weak and southward, but not directly linked to instability.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifted Index (LI = 1.7)</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A LI of ~1.7 is slightly positive, indicating weak instability. While not strongly convective, it suggests the potential for thunderstorms if lifted.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wind Shear (SRH1e = 43, SRH3e = 92)</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High storm-relative helicity (SRH) values (especially SRH3e = 92) indicate strong low-level wind shear, which is critical for supercell development.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moisture Profile (PW = 18.1 mm)</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High precipitable water (PW) implies a moist atmosphere, supporting convective growth.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freezing Level (FZLh = 2596 m)</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freezing levels are elevated, which could reduce hail size but may still allow for significant precipitation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lapse Rates and Stability</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moist lapse rate (LR75 = -6.7°C/100m) suggests a stable layer near the surface, but the presence of high PW and SRH indicates a potential for instability in the mid-troposphere.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upper-Level Winds</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>Strong winds at 250hPa (45 m/s) suggest a strong jet stream, which can enhance vertical shear and trigger convection.  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Critical Uncertainties:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Resolution</strong>: The RAP model may not resolve small-scale features critical for severe weather.  </li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Observations</strong>: Missing current surface conditions (e.g., pressure trends, moisture advection) and radar data for storm initiation.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>TOOL_CALLS:</h3>
<p>TOOL_CALL: {"tool_name": "get_surface_observations", "arguments": {"station_id": "JKL", "time": "2025-03-14T07:00Z"}}<br />
TOOL_CALL: {"tool_name": "get_latest_radar_imagery", "arguments": {"latitude": 37.59, "longitude": -83.32, "time": "2025-03-14T07:00Z"}}  </p>
<h3>FORECAST_SUMMARY:</h3>
<p>FORECAST_SUMMARY: A marginal risk of severe thunderstorms is possible around 0700Z on 03/14/2025, driven by high storm-relative helicity (SRH3e = 92) and weak instability (LI = 1.7). High precipitable water (PW = 18.1 mm) supports convective development, but surface observations and radar imagery are needed to confirm storm initiation and severity. Watch for potential downburst winds or isolated hail.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>
