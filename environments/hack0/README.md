## Environment Design & Motivation
NousWhiteHouse is a reinforcement learning (RL) project focused on improving agent tool calls using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The goal is to enable agents to dynamically discover and invoke tools more effectively, leveraging MCP for context-aware decision-making. 

After replicating RESTGPT, we noticed that LLMs struggled to find the right tools to call, such as finding Gims songs on Spotify. Instead of manually matching multiple APIs, the recent advent of Modex Context Protocol inspires us to double down on tool-calling efforts
